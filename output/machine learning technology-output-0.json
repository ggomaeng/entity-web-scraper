["","While many machine learning algorithms have been around for a long time, the ability to automatically apply complex mathematical calculations to big data – over and over, faster and faster – is a recent development. Here are a few widely publicized examples of machine learning applications you may be familiar with:Most industries working with large amounts of data have recognized the value of machine learning technology. By gleaning insights from this data – often in real time – organizations are able to work more efficiently or gain an advantage over competitors.Data mining can be considered a superset of many different methods to extract insights from data. It might involve traditional statistical methods and machine learning. Data mining applies methods from many different areas to identify previously unknown patterns from data. This can include statistical algorithms, machine learning, text analytics, time series analysis and other areas of analytics. Data mining also includes the study and practice of data storage and data manipulation.The main difference with machine learning is that just like statistical models, the goal is to understand the structure of the data – fit theoretical distributions to the data that are well understood. So, with statistical models there is a theory behind the model that is mathematically proven, but this requires that data meets certain strong assumptions too. Machine learning has developed based on the ability to use computers to probe the data for structure, even if we do not have a theory of what that structure looks like. The test for a machine learning model is a validation error on new data, not a theoretical test that proves a null hypothesis. Because machine learning often uses an iterative approach to learn from data, the learning can be easily automated. Passes are run through the data until a robust pattern is found.To get the most value from machine learning, you have to know how to pair the best algorithms with the right tools and processes. SAS combines rich, sophisticated heritage in statistics and data mining with new architectural advances to ensure your models run as fast as possible – even in huge enterprise environments.Those driverless cars we keep hearing about from Google? They’re just one example of machine learning – and we’re about to hear of many more.

Python is fragmented by comprehensive and can be very slow unless you drop into C. He prefers Python when not working with a well defined feature matrix and uses Pandas and NLTK. Ben comments that “As a general rule, if it’s found to be interesting for statisticians, it’s been implemented in R” (well said). He also complains about the language itself being ugly and painful to work with. Finally, Ben comments on Julia that doesn’t have much to offer in the way of libraries but is his new favorite language. He comments that it has the conciseness of languages like MATLAB and Python with the speed of C.R is a workhorse for statistical analysis and by extension machine learning. Much talk is given to the learning curve, I didn’t really see the problem. It is the platform to use to understand and explore your data using statistical methods and graphs. It has an enormous number of machine learning algorithms, and advanced implementations too written by the developers of the algorithm.Implementing a system that uses machine learning is an engineering challenge like any other. You need good design and developed requirements. Machine learning is algorithms, not magic. When it comes to serious production implementations, you need a robust library or you customize an implementation of the algorithm for your needs.I am admittedly new to ML but have recently had the opportunity to try it with R, python, and Matlab.  You can divide up the problem into different parts.  In all cases, it’s a good idea to go beyond the basic installation: for R, you want RStudio as an IDE; for python, IPython notebooks and several major libraries are a must; and Matlab is much nicer to work in than Octave.  1. Data input, output, preprocessing, and postprocessing: Python, hands down.  It’s all fine and good if you are just dealing with CSVs but that is often not the case, so in the real world python is quite handy.  Frankly, there are few languages better at this than python, and it is surely a big part of its popularity.  8. Performance: I can’t really say for sure, as I have not properly tested.  Python is the only one of the three in which out-of-core or online processing is particularly natural to express, thanks to generators, as far as I can tell.  There are many interesting code performance initiatives in place for Python.  Other languages should obviously perform better (C, java; as noted Julia is particularly interesting).Another language to consider is Lua. Specifically the LuaJIT implementation with Touch7. This is what Google and Facebook AI groups use, probably because they hired a folks from Yann LaCun’s lab. Torch7 has been extended further with more ML stuff produced at Facebook and they have made it available to the public. Probably check out stuff on why Lua/LuaJit over Python and LuaJIT’s interface with c-code. Also, LuaJIT is used a lot by gamers and I heard LuaJIT (or was it Lua) will replace Action Script in Adobe’s products.You make several good points about context. I would add that there is a dimension which runs from “scripting” (summoning existing machine learning routines) to “programming” (writing the machine learning routines oneself). Some languages lend themselves more to one of these operations more than the other. In SAS, for instance, analysts tend to call existing SAS “procs”: They are not writing logistic regression from scratch.If a script-writing analyst and I fit such the same model form to the same data, we will get the same model parameters. The differences are that I know how and why that modeling process works (and when it won’t), and I can modify it directly when needed.Even me (I am the author of Accord.NET mentioned a few comments above) I use scikit-learn on a daily basis for production use at work. However, if for any reason you or any of your blog readers would like to use machine learning in contexts where Python just wouldn’t be available (such as embedded devices through Xamarin, UWP apps or even Java), please give Accord.NET a try.If you find issues in your application, or something that you believe should have been done better, register it at the project’s issue tracker and it should be taken care of in no time. The goal of this project is also to address platforms which have not been historically been served very well by Python-only implementations."," You can use the ML model to get predictions on new data for which you do not know\n                        the\n                        target. For example, let's say that you want to train an ML model to predict if an\n                        email is spam\n                        or not spam. You would provide Amazon ML with training data that contains emails for\n                        which you know\n                        the target (that is, a label that tells whether an email is spam or not spam). Amazon\n                        ML would train\n                        an ML model by using this data, resulting in a model that attempts to predict whether\n                        new email\n                        will be spam or not spam. \n                     ","While many machine learning algorithms have been around for a long time, the ability to automatically apply complex mathematical calculations to big data – over and over, faster and faster – is a recent development.

Basic concepts in probability, statistics, programming, linear algebra, and calculus will be discussed, but it isn’t necessary to have prior knowledge of them to gain value from this series.Artificial intelligence will shape our future more powerfully than any other innovation this century. Anyone who does not understand it will soon find themselves feeling left behind, waking up in a world full of technology that feels more and more like magic.In everyday life, it’s increasingly commonplace to discover machines in roles traditionally occupied by humans. Really, don’t be surprised if a little housekeeping delivery bot shows up instead of a human next time you call the hotel desk to send up some toothpaste.In this series, we’ll explore the core machine learning concepts behind these technologies. By the end, you should be able to describe how they work at a conceptual level and be equipped with the tools to start building similar applications yourself.“It’s part of the history of the field of artificial intelligence that every time somebody figured out how to make a computer do something — play good checkers, solve simple but relatively informal problems — there was chorus of critics to say, ‘that’s not thinking’”Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an ‘intelligence explosion,’ and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control. — I.J. Good, 1965Machine learning is at the core of our journey towards artificial general intelligence, and in the meantime, it will change every industry and have a massive impact on our day-to-day lives. That’s why we believe it’s worth understanding machine learning, at least at a conceptual level — and we designed this series to be the best place to start.Most of this series was written during a 10-day trip to the United Kingdom in a frantic blur of trains, planes, cafes, pubs and wherever else we could find a dry place to sit. Our aim was to solidify our own understanding of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and how the methods therein fit together — and hopefully create something worth sharing in the process.","\n     Machine Learning APIs make it easy for developers to develop predictive applications. Here we review 5 important Machine Learning APIs: IBM Watson, Microsoft Azure Machine Learning, Google Prediction API, Amazon Machine Learning API, and BigML.\n  Big data is streaming into businesses all over the Internet from various data sources like sensors, social media data, excel spreadsheets, reviews, customer data, etc. There are many companies like Google, IBM, Amazon, and Microsoft helping businesses process big data by building Machine Learning APIs so that organizations can make the best use of the machine learning technology.Machine Learning is the big frontier in big data innovation but it is daunting for people who are not tech geeks or data science domain experts.Similar to how standard APIs help developers create applications, Machine Learning APIs make machine learning easy to use, for everyone. Machine Learning APIs abstract the complexities involved in creating and deploying machine learning models so that developers can focus on data munging, user experience, design, experimenting and delivering insights from data.In the early days, machine learning algorithms and technologies were mostly used by scientists, tech geeks or domain experts. However, several organizations are now using Machine Learning APIs to make these technologies available to the masses. Machine Learning APIs make it easy for developers to apply machine learning to a dataset so as to add predictive features to their applications. Machine Learning APIs provide an abstraction layer for developers to integrate machine learning in real world applications without having to worry about scaling the algorithms on their infrastructure and getting into the details of the machine learning algorithms. Machine Learning APIs require developers to focus on the two important aspects-Machine Learning APIs provide businesses with the ability to bring together predictive analytics so that they can get to know their customers better, understand their requirements and deliver products or services based on the past data trends, thereby initiating the selling process.There is an increasing percentage of real time consumer interactions through Machine Learning APIs – making them an ideal option for exposing real time predictive analytics to app developers.Application developers always look for various ways to ease the lives of their users by introducing novel and innovative features that can help users save time. This is the reason for the popularity of Machine Learning APIs in app developers. Some standard examples of these APIs include Smart Tagging, Product Recommendations, Priority Filtering, and Spam Filtering.The latest trend in Machine learning to be commoditized into a service which will develop into the mainstream as commoditized visualization and storage.
