["","These peer-to-peer decentralized networks enable developers to create markets for transactions of goods and services, without a middleman. This can drastically reduce the time it takes to make and log transactions as well as the cost and labor involved in property transfers.When you buy a car, there are multiple parties involved and a number of financial transactions. You want to check the car's ownership history, if there were any accidents or repairs, connect with a title agency, maybe get financing from a lender, etc. You could write these conditions into the blockchain in such a way that the entire transaction is transparent to all parties and happens quickly without a lot of effort. The transaction history will move with the car through its entire life as well, making it just as easy for anyone to purchase it and do the research moving forward.You are looking to purchase the finest apple the world has ever seen. You could look through the blockchain to see where the seeds were purchased, where the apple was grown, pesticides that were used (if any) and the current owner of the apple. Purchase the apple and add your transaction to the blockchain.","Enter the sharing economy. The sharing economy burst into our lives as a big promise during the 2008 recession with an initial wave of investor enthusiasm and a number of “sharing” startups such as Uber and Airbnb. However, many others failed to ride the trend.Blockchain can help energize and unlock the sharing economy by making it cheaper to create and operate an online platform. For example, transactions could be coordinated by self-executing smart contracts or performed at lower cost by other small competing providers. The next phase of the sharing economy can emphasize today’s inequalities or ease them, depending on the purpose of the technology itself.Basically, blockchain is a different way of keeping track of a normative set of information, instead of storing the information in one central location – the county records office, say, or Airbnb’s database – blockchain makes multiple copies and distributes them across all the nodes of a network. These nodes don’t have to be people, they can be things. This is what makes blockchain a potentially powerful accelerant of the sharing economy as it gives a property the ability to know who its owner is.Anything with an internet connection can hook up to a blockchain, which means anything with an internet connection can have a perfect record of who owns what. So let’s say I rent out my house, like I would on Airbnb. By utilizing blockchain technology, I could program my front door to open only when a person reserved it, and automatically pay me, and lock the door, once he leaves the property.The increasing need for clean energy has influenced the platform to choose solar panels and energy generation as its first initiative. Through its initiative, MyBit is presently on a mission to accelerate the adoption of decentralized grid among the masses.","Blockchain has the potential to transform industry operating models. However, while noise around the distributed ledger technology grew steadily throughout the year, the majority of companies are still stuck in the exploration phase, beguiled by its beauty but unable to translate this fascination into practical applications.Its primary applications still reside in banking. In an IBM study released this year, 15% of banks said they have plans to put blockchain into commercial production by 2017, and 91% of banks are investing in blockchain for deposit-taking. The World Economic Forum, meanwhile, estimates that some 80% of banks are actively working on blockchain projects.However, it is not only finance that blockchain is set to disrupt. According to PwC expert Seamus Cushley, the last nine months has seen $1.4bn invested globally in blockchain startups across numerous sectors, and the technology is advancing quickly. We’ve looked at what the year ahead holds.According to the latest edition of KPMG and CB Insights report ‘Pulse of Fintech Q3’16’, blockchain and bitcoin investment activity in fintech fell to $87 million in the third quarter of 2016, down from $119 million in the second quarter and $153 million in the first. While the total is still expected to exceed 2015’s total, the fall indicates that investors are beginning to grow concerned that exploration is not translating into action. The excitement remains, but this has been somewhat tempered, as the KPMG report notes:‘To-date, however, the ability to move blockchain from proof-of-concept to adoption and production has been minimal. While the market is still giving blockchain companies plenty of room to prove themselves, investors are also becoming more concerned about results’, the report said. ‘Over the next year, investors will make more rationale assessments of where the main use cases associated with fintech are and how long it will be before they are implementable.’Blockchain technology has received the most VC investor attention in North America, where large financial institutions have invested in blockchain related projects, but funding is falling. In China, however, it is on the up, with this year record-breaking for fintech investment, posting increases for each of the past four quarters. There is still significant room for growth in Asia in 2017, though. KPMG China's fintech and innovation partner, Raymond Chang, said investors remain interested, just not in massive rounds, noting ‘VC investors are putting a lot of money into small blockchain technology companies in Asia. Some very new companies are already into their second or third round of funding.’ This steady trickle of smaller projects is already starting to lead to larger investments, with Chinese investors recently taking part in a funding round worth $1.7 million for Taiwanese startup Bitmark, a trend that should continue into the next year.While companies like Uber and Airbnb have disrupted industries across the board by linking consumers with things they need, they are still middle men, and they still take a cut. Blockchain has the capabilities to remove such middle men entirely, meaning whoever has what someone needs takes their full dues. Arcade City, for example, is a new ride-sharing app that connects drivers with customers peer-to-peer using the Ethereum blockchain. Arcade City’s founder, Christopher David, a former Uber driver, argues that, ‘The Achilles’ heel of Uber and Lyft is their centralized management of pricing. By decentralizing that decision to the level of the driver and rider, Arcade City frees the driver to be an entrepreneur, and empowers the rider with control over their entire experience. Both drivers and riders are loving it so far.’ In May of this year, Arcade City came first in the blockchain startup category at the GTEC Awards in Berlin.There is similar potential for blockchain to disrupt the music industry. Streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music have grown quickly, but they still act as middlemen. With a decentralized database like blockchain, the artist has the power, retaining control over all uploading, marketing, and selling of any work they create. Edith Suarez of CNN explained that blockchain could change how they are paid too, an issue that has particularly impacted platforms such as Spotify because of the lack of transparency and drawn criticism from major artists such as Radiohead and Taylor Swift. Suarez noted that: ‘Music is placed in the decentralized server, then each song is embedded with a piece of code (meta information) […] [When people download] a track with a cryptocurrency, a payment is automatically sent to anyone involved, be it the writer, the producer, the singer, as well as many others.’Countries around the world are already looking at how they could mint their own digital currencies and put money on the blockchain, and they are expanding exploration into other areas of government. In Delaware, for example, Governor Jack Markell announced two Blockchain initiatives earlier this year. One moves state archival records to an open distributed ledger, while the other allows a private company that incorporates in that state to keep track of all the equity issued and the different shareholder rights on the blockchain. Estonia, meanwhile, has used Blockchain to develop an e-residency program, whereby anyone in the world can apply to become an e-resident of Estonia, and the UK government has tested Blockchain on a small scale to see how it can be utilized to help pay people’s welfare.2016 saw the first shoots of a regulatory regime for blockchain, with Japan’s legislature passing a recent bill to regulate bitcoin exchanges in the country. Next year, as the technology grows in terms of adoption and popularity, we will see a growing focus on security and other risk issues, which will bring regulators to the frontlines. At such a nascent stage, regulators are still trying to balance allowing the technology to grow while not letting it run unfettered, and they are already collaborating with startups to tread this line.In South Korea, for example, financial regulators have launched a digital currency task force focused on regulatory and licensing parameters for bitcoin exchanges with the aim of introducing regulations in 2017, while the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is also in the process of developing an approval process for blockchain projects.In the US, a number of states are already preparing to introduce regulation of Bitcoin exchanges. They are likely follow the State of New York’s BitLicense regime, but the fragmented approach we have seen in the US around FinTech regulation will needs to be re-examined. It has caused significant confusion as to how firms are subjected to regulatory oversight, with 50 state regulation and multiple federal regulators adding complication, and this could greatly stymie blockchain innovations.Blockchain is still in an extremely new technology, and education remains the biggest challenge. There are issues around security, as we saw earlier this year when Ether was hacked, and there will likely be a steep learning curve ahead in 2017. Companies must not get put off by a few bumps in the road though, and they must not panic if proof of concepts do not reveal themselves immediately. They are going to have to continue to improve their understanding and work with other companies and form new strategic partnerships. Early adopters are always going to be the ones that truly benefit from a technology, and organizations need to get to grips with how they can use blockchain as soon as possible if they are to realize its massive potential for disruption. Copyright © 2017 The Innovation Enterprise Ltd.

Cloud computing has gone mainstream for many enterprises, and the Internet of Things (IoT) is changing how both industrial and consumer-oriented companies do business. Drones and autonomous vehicles, blockchain, augmented and virtual reality, increasingly sophisticated digital assistants, machine learning (artificial intelligence, or AI) — the list of technological megatrends just keeps growing.At the center of this continuing wave of innovation is the technology industry, and in particular a set of U.S.-based supercompetitors we call the “Big Five”: Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft. Already dominant in their own fields — high-end devices, digital content distribution and app stores, online search and advertising, social media, e-commerce, cloud services, and productivity software — they are actively branching out into new businesses. And they have substantial advantages in doing so: positive network effects inherent in their hyper-scale platform businesses, formidable innovation capabilities, and massive financial muscle.And yet the Big Five have competition. Many other technology players are making strong efforts to recover (if they have fallen behind) and to build sustainable businesses. These are exemplified by the “Next 20”: the largest U.S.-based technology companies after the Big Five, based on enterprise value: Adobe, Analog Devices, Applied Materials, Broadcom, Cisco Systems, Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, HP Inc., IBM, Intel, Intuit, Micron, Nvidia, Oracle, Qualcomm, Salesforce.com, Symantec, Texas Instruments, VMware, and Western Digital. Each in its own way is shifting from pure hardware to software-defined hardware and from products to services, managed services, and solutions.Further disruption will come from five other companies, all of them based in China: Alibaba, Baidu, Huawei, JD.com, and Tencent. Highly successful in their home market, these companies have been expanding their scope around the globe; Huawei, for instance, has been active outside China for more than 10 years. The competitive struggle within and among these three groups of companies — the Big Five, the Next 20, and the Chinese Challengers — will define the technology industry for the foreseeable future.One final arena of competition should be mentioned: sectors such as industrial operations, financial services, and healthcare, where battles are being fought for dominance in the IoT and related fields. As GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt has pointed out, established companies in many traditional fields have no choice but to become more like software companies. For example, with its Predix platform, GE has recast itself as a digital and software-driven company and is developing a leadership position in the Industrial Internet of Things. A few healthcare chiefs, most notably Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini, have begun to create technology platforms for taking costs out of and transforming the overall system. Telecommunications firms, including Verizon and AT&T, are investing in 5G, the IoT, content, advertising, and emerging distribution technologies. In other nascent areas, such as blockchain and augmented and virtual reality, no clear leader has emerged, but here too, companies in financial services or media may compete.Amazon’s story is particularly noteworthy, because it shows the unpredictable nature of success in the tech sector today. Cloud computing was a logical business model extension for Microsoft and Alphabet, but Amazon’s move from consumer-oriented e-commerce retail to cloud services for business customers was originally seen as a stretch. When it launched its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud unit in 2006, Amazon had often been under fire for the size of its investments, which had resulted in lower margins and lower profits that could be used to pay back investors. Outsiders were skeptical that the company could successfully launch the new offering, let alone compete with Microsoft and Google. Nonetheless, as of late 2016, Amazon’s AWS unit has captured by far the largest share of the corporate cloud computing business, controlling 70 percent or more of the public cloud infrastructure market, according to Oppenheimer & Co. Microsoft and Alphabet are second and third, respectively.Meanwhile, the war for talent rages on — and indeed, may even heat up, if it becomes more difficult for U.S. companies to hire talented immigrants under the new U.S. administration. In early January 2017, Amazon announced it would be hiring 100,000 new employees in the United States. Although many of these jobs will be in distribution centers and logistics networks, some recruits will be software and hardware engineers, joining areas of the firm dedicated to growing AWS, Alexa, drones, and other highly technical offerings.What’s left for the Next 20? Many of them are trying to reposition themselves by focusing on high-growth areas. IBM, for example, is placing a large bet on artificial intelligence with its Watson business. Texas Instruments is targeting analog chip markets for sensors and video processors, booming areas in the automotive and industrial sectors. And Adobe is aggressively marketing its products in cloud computing environments. Other hardware, software, and technology service firms, including many that gained prominence in the 1980s and 1990s, are struggling to compete, and going through major restructurings in hopes of moving away from their legacy offerings.Many of these companies — and other long-established but smaller tech companies — already recognize their disadvantaged position compared with the Big Five. To compete, even in a relatively focused way, they must make significant changes to their operating models and corresponding cost structures, shift the talent mix of their workforce to build new capabilities, and embrace “as-a-service” business models (under which software and other products are sold by subscription or through online relationships, rather than with a one-time purchase). They must also keep their legacy businesses profitable for as long as possible to generate the cash flow and profits needed to reinvest in growth areas. Though just about every tech leader recognizes the urgent need to make these changes, some are executing them more effectively than others. These changes, such as moving from a licensed software business model to a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model — a transformation few of the Next 20 companies have completed — hold significant implications for revenue, cash flow, and margins in addition to their operating models, go-to-market strategies, and talent pools.One of the most commonly prioritized growth areas for companies today is the IoT and its many components, including sensors, actuators, connectivity, real-time analytics, and managed services. Lots of companies will likely benefit considerably as the build-out of the IoT gains momentum. According to Gartner, the installed base of connected devices will grow from about 6.5 billion in 2016 to more than 20 billion by 2020. But many participants in the IoT ecosystem face a perennial risk: Value is often a function of scale in their business, and as end-user markets become saturated and new technologies rise, they will experience the shrinking margins of commoditization. When this shift occurs, technology companies that have developed platforms and scale will be in the best position, especially if they also have access to the data generated by their customers’ use of the hardware and software. In those cases, companies will try to employ the data to expand the relationship with these customers into new applications, such as information analytics and equipment networking.As successful as the Big Five have been and will likely continue to be, they face increasing competition from China’s own tech supercompetitors. Their efforts correspond in some ways to those of the Big Five: Amazon faces off with Alibaba and JD.com in e-commerce, Google with Baidu in search, and Facebook with Tencent in chat, photo sharing, and social media. Huawei’s primary focus has been a bit different; the company offers networking services and equipment, including mobile phones, and has strong backing from the Chinese government. Its evolving phone business will pit it more closely against Apple (and Samsung).All these companies are highly successful in their home market and are growing more rapidly than the Big Five, and far more rapidly than the rest of the U.S. tech industry. As they gain even more traction in markets traditionally served by their Western competition or not yet dominated by any single player in a given segment, a land grab among these platforms is likely to ensue, in particular in emerging markets.The Chinese Challengers do not compete on an entirely level playing field, especially within China. The Big Five are seen as outsiders in the country, and they continue to face challenges in serving consumers or companies in China — as of January 2017, consumers in mainland China were still unable to access many of Alphabet’s consumer-facing Web properties and applications, including Google, Gmail, and YouTube, and Facebook was also blocked. Within China, the Chinese companies have been designated as winners by the Chinese government, a base on which they have captured the lion’s share of their home markets.The Chinese Challengers have also used that base to gain share in markets abroad; Huawei in particular has been able to compete effectively on price with telecom equipment rivals from other countries. But as they continue to expand, the Chinese Challengers will face tougher competition, especially from the U.S. companies, such as Alphabet, Amazon, and Facebook, that they have so successfully emulated at home. Will these players be able to develop the products, business models, and go-to-market innovation needed to compete globally? Will they put in place security and censorship policies that are flexible enough to placate powerful regulators at home, while still satisfying varied interests abroad? And what might rising nationalism and protectionism around the world mean for the evolution of their ambitions?The Chinese Challengers will no doubt continue to solidify their lead at home. Alibaba and Amazon will likely compete on the e-commerce front across many global markets. Huawei competes with Apple in devices, and with companies such as Cisco and Nokia in infrastructure, albeit at very different price points so far.What does the increasing power of the Big Five and their Chinese Challengers mean for the technology industry as a whole? Winning in the tech space is no longer simply a matter of understanding a customer need and using a new technology or channel to build a product or service value proposition to fulfill it.The Big Five have succeeded by developing a clear strategic identity, the distinctive set of capabilities required to translate their strategy into winning business models, and a well-defined portfolio of platforms, products, and services.There is no inherent reason why the Next 20 can’t follow the same playbook, define a strategy and capabilities system based on a strong identity, build a future-oriented operating model and cost structure, and leverage a distinctive talent base and culture to differentiate themselves by customer value. That said, it is certainly not wise to choose a strategic identity that puts one in direct competition with Alphabet, or Amazon, or Facebook. But given the multitude of growth areas, new technologies, and cross-vertical disruptions surrounding technology companies, there is still ample opportunity to define winning strategies and create new multibillion-dollar businesses — even in areas where the Big Five and Chinese Challengers are already competing as well. As long as the Next 20 (and beyond) don’t try to do too much with too little commitment, there is hope and a lot of opportunity.As for the Chinese Challengers, they are both helped and hindered by their established dominance in their home market. That market will potentially be larger and more lucrative in the long term than the U.S. market; China already exceeds the U.S. in online customer count and in mobile phone users. But as these companies begin to compete in international markets, they will have to force themselves to build capabilities that are not very important in their home markets. In some ways, they are already rising to this challenge — they are fierce and persistent competitors — but they have not yet demonstrated the type of product or business model innovation that can easily translate beyond China and that would allow them to play the kind of global role that the Big Five play today.","China's major exchanges introduced trading fees amidst regulatory pressure from the People’s Bank of China earlier this year, and CoinDesk Research delved deeper into the new post-fee market shares to gain a more realistic outlook on bitcoin exchange traded volume.In post-fee world, the former 'Big 3' have seen a startling drop in exchange traded volume.
