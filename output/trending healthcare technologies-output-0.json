["\n            Various experts in healthcare IT see a number of trends increasing in influence for provider organizations during the next 12 months. We queried several key knowledge experts in the field and compiled this list of technologies and trends that are likely to impact provider organizations over the coming years.\n        ","\n\tMeanwhile, provider executives need to focus on delivering high-quality patient care and payer executives need to continue to retain members—all with an eye on quality, cost, and patient and member satisfaction. To be sure, both payer and provider executives will continue to plan for the projected 80 million Medicare beneficiaries in 2030. Still, seniors will soon be outnumbered by millennials as the patients demanding care from the U.S. healthcare system.\n\tPam Jodock, senior director of health business solutions at the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS), uses the Center for Connected Health Policy’s definition of telehealth; namely, that it’s “a collection of means or methods for enhancing healthcare, public health, and health education delivery and support using telecommunications technologies.” Examples of this type of care include a physician answering patient questions via secure e-mail or a patient portal, or a live video conversation in which a clinician serves as an intermediary between the patient who’s there in person with a specialist located miles away, says Jodock.\n\tConsumers are much more digitally attuned than ever before, and they want the delivery of their healthcare to be convenient and easy, says Jodock. Still, telehealth visits are reimbursed at lower rates than “brick-and-mortar-based” visits, largely because it’s easier for providers to administer such visits. There are upfront costs, of course, and that’s for the investment in technology to enable remote visits with patients, she says.\n\tFor providers who remain hesitant to embrace telehealth, alternative payment models could be a motivator. For example, providers that face value-based measures related to diabetic patient care may need to embrace telehealth devices, such as remote glucose monitors, that provide real-time patient monitoring capabilities. “The success of ACOs will hinge upon their ability to increase their use of connected health technologies and convert that information into action,” says Jodock, who points out that 98% of outcomes are based on what happens outside the physician’s office—and, therefore, outside the physician’s control. “Physicians need to develop partnerships with patients to allow them to have real-time information about their health status so that [their physician] can intervene in a more rapid and efficient way,” she says. “This also allows patients to be more engaged in their own outcomes and helps them do a better job of adhering to their blood pressure medications or their insulin for diabetes.”\n\tThat’s why Mitch Morris, MD, vice chair and global healthcare sector leader at consulting firm Deloitte, expects 2017 to be a “breakout year” for telehealth solutions—despite budgetary pressures. He says that access to real-time data about illnesses such as diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma will be a must for providers. In addition, there will be a continuing drive toward care provided outside of the hospital and into home and school environments.All comments must follow the ModernMedicine Network community rules and terms of use, and will be moderated.

Medical 3-D imaging is not new, but the way organs appear to pop out of the screen and the ease at which the anatomy can be manipulated has never been seen before in medicine.Ability to get a patient into an appointment is critical.  Not only for a patient’s health, but for the viability of a health system from a revenue standpoint, its reputation, the insurance company, and even medical device and pharma companies.  It is a tight knit ecosystem where if one chain in the communication link breaks down then all heck breaks lose and everyone suffers.Sergio Canavero , an Italian neurosurgeon, intends to attempt the first human head transplant by 2017, though no successful animal transplants with long-term survival have yet been made. Because of the difficulty of connecting the spinal cord, Canavero has suggested improvements in the process using a special blade and polyethylene glycol, a polymer used in medicine as well as in everything from skin cream to the conservation of the Mary Rose, can help start growth in spinal cord nerves.Being able to surgically remove the head in an orderly fashion should allow surgeons to then reattach all the nerves and blood vessels to the new body, once that pesky donor head is removed. A special bio-compatible glue will hold the spinal cord together so it can fuse with the donor body. The patient will then be put in a drug-induced coma for four weeks while the connection between the head and body heals. It’s the reattachment process that’s the most unlikely part of all this. There’s never been a successful procedure that reattached a fully severed primate spinal cord.Canavero says all the technology he needs is available, and estimates the procedure will take about 36 hours and require the services of 150 medical professionals. He expects a 90% chance of success, as in a 90% chance the patient is up and walking around a few months after the surgery. This all still sounds like science fiction, and medical professionals are mostly skeptical of Canavero’s plan. He seems set to try, though. And who knows? Maybe it’ll work. A few years ago face transplants seemed like science fiction. Even if this does work, the process will be obscenely expensive. Plus, it will give an entire body full of transplantable organs to a single person. It’s unclear if this would be considered ethical when there are so many people waiting for transplants.Diagnosing patients has always been challenging without in-depth testing, one day soon we may have devices that can help determine aliments in seconds versus hours or days.   The future is coming and Star Trek fans like me are hoping it’s sooner then later.Cardiac transplantation, also called heart transplantation, has evolved into the treatment of choice for many people with severe heart failure who have severe symptoms despite maximum medical therapy. Survival among cardiac transplant recipients has improved as a result of improvements in treatments that suppress the immune system and prevent infection.Unfortunately, the number of heart donors has reached a plateau despite an increasing number of potential recipients. More than 5000 cardiac transplants occur each year around the world, although it is estimated that up to 50,000 people are candidates for transplantation . This critical organ shortage means that healthcare providers must strictly evaluate who should receive a heart transplant.“I stared at the thing in disbelief,” he said. This was exactly what was needed to drive a sick human heart! For the next five years, most of the world’s pacemakers used that simple blocking oscillator design — just because of Greatbatch’s accident.The process is long and tedious prior to  approval of any new drug  by regulatory agencies.  Idea is to ensure  that drug should show it’s effectiveness in a convincing manner and it’s  effects should weigh over it’s side effects before it reaches  market.Additionally, a doctor or a pharmacist would be able to use each patient’s individual information — such as age, race and gender — to produce their optimal medication dose, rather than relying on a standard set of dosages. 3D printing may also allow pills to be printed in a complex construct of layers, using a combination of drugs to treat multiple ailments at once. The idea is to give patients one single pill that offers treatment for everything they need.With Internet of Things devices, clinicians “in the PACU … can see what’s going on in the ORs, where they are in the case, and can therefore interpret when people are going to arrive in PACU,” Cook explained. “And likewise, people up on the med-surg floor can see what’s going on in PACU” and prepare for new patient arrivals.Consumerism has been making inroads into the healthcare industry for at least a decade, with patients increasingly acting like consumers who have a choice in their healthcare options, trying to make the best decisions for quality and cost just as they do with any other commodity. The trend has been accelerated by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which left many consumers with large deductibles that put more pressure on them to find the most cost-effective care for the dollars coming out of their own pockets.Consumerism appears to have more impact on outpatient services than inpatient care, says Mark Bogen, senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer at South Nassau Communities Hospital, a 400-staffed-bed acute care facility in Oceanside, New York. Patients still rely on their physicians to refer them to the appropriate hospital and generally don’t question that choice unless the facility is out of network. It’s only at that point that most patients will speak up and ask about an in-network alternative, he says.“I still believe it’s crass to call them consumers,” he says. “On the outpatient side, it’s more fitting that people will shop for price, and you could argue that much of the outpatient services are commodities, but I don’t believe that to be true from an inpatient perspective, and I would hate to have people make what ultimately could be a life-and-death decision on the basis of cost.”Imagine having the equivalents of a gatekeeper, a multilingual translator, an air traffic controller, and a bouncer in your nervous system. Now imagine that this team can modulate and redirect signals from the brain and the rest of your nervous system to other systems and organs in your body. Any signals heading the wrong way or behaving erratically could be course-corrected along the way. That’s a rough translation of the concept of bioelectronics.If Dr Daniel Chew’s work goes to plan, diabetics and sufferers from a host of other diseases may one day no longer need to inject themselves or take pills. He’s working to develop a tiny implant that could read and alter electrical signals that pass along nerves in the body and help control illness.“Our work has huge potential to treat a vast array of different diseases,” says Chew. “Five years ago, bioelectronic medicine was barely even a concept.” Before he joined GSK, Chew spent a decade in research, which included investigating the use of electronic implants to treat patients with spinal cord injuries and help restore bladder and bowel control. “My work was pre-clinical in the lab but I also worked closely with vets to apply these electronic implants to treat pet dogs that had suffered similar trauma,” he explains.The amount of work we are tasked at performing is ever increasing, yet we are asked to do it with less resources then ever before.  In the future as costs come down more health systems will be able to leverage advanced computer systems to help provide clinical support for their patients.Currently the volume of healthcare data recently reached 150 exabytes. At projected growth rates, the volume of healthcare data will soon be zettabyte and yottabyte scale. That’s enough data to fill a stack of DVDs that would stretch from Earth to Mars.The world’s technological capacity to store information grew from 2.6 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 1986 to 15.8 in 1993, over 54.5 in 2000, and to 295 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2007. This is equivalent to less than one 730-MB CD-ROM per person in 1986 (539 MB per person), roughly 4 CD-ROM per person of 1993, 12 CD-ROM per person in the year 2000, and almost 61 CD-ROM per person in 2007. Piling up the imagined 404 billion CD-ROM from 2007 would create a stack from the earth to the moon and a quarter of this distance beyond (with 1.2 mm thickness per CD).The world’s technological capacity to receive information through one-way broadcast networks was 432 exabytes of (optimally compressed) information in 1986, 715 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 1993, 1,200 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2000, and 1,900 in 2007.According to the CSIRO, in the next decade, astronomers expect to be processing 10 petabytes of data every hour from the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescope. The array is thus expected to generate approximately one exabyte every four days of operation. According to IBM, the new SKA telescope initiative will generate over an exabyte of data every day. IBM is designing hardware to process this information.Every year, 600,000 people have metal coronary stents put into their chests to treat coronary artery blockage. Most of the time, that stent stays there forever, long after its mission is complete. The stents may inhibit natural blood flow and cause other complications, like blood clots.What if they could just disappear? That is a long-sought goal researchers have finally met. This past July, the first bioabsorbable stent was approved in the United States. Made of a naturally dissolving polymer, the stent widens the clogged artery for two years before it is absorbed into the body in a manner similar to dissolvable sutures.The disappearing stent leaves behind a healthy natural artery. The patient is free to go off blood clotting medication and qualifies for a broader range of medical treatments. What’s more, recovery time has been reduced from three to four weeks for metal stents to just a few days.Only one version of an absorbable stent has been FDA approved but more are coming. Experts believe the market potential will approach $2 billion in six years. While the full impact of vanishing stents is yet to be seen, 2017 is the year the technology becomes a game changer.Jonathan has a proven record of entrepreneurial success in the healthcare field.

The desire to better understand mountains of untapped data is on the rise. And the necessity to start improving the health not just of patients but of whole populations is being taken quite seriously.Asked which technologies they are planning to upgrade in 2017, 52 percent of survey respondents said security, 51 percent analytics, 44 percent patient engagement, 44 percent population health, 31 percent EHRs, 24 percent remote patient monitoring, and 22 percent revenue cycle management.“From the standpoint of security being No. 1, it certainly is one of the most critical things in healthcare today,” Fisne said. “We are in an age where technology has extended so far into the realm of healthcare that it has become one of the most critical things, so the heightened need for security follows. And analytics is key, as well. We are investing in some of the Big Data platforms to take information and demonstrate trends, practices and patterns of care, as well as patterns of illness along the way. And that goes hand in hand with population health.”2017 also will see the arrival of technologies at many healthcare organizations. Asked which technologies they plan to introduce or investigate in 2017, 45 percent of survey respondents said analytics, 45 percent workflow improvement, 44 percent telehealth, 41 percent population health, 41 percent smart medical devices, 34 percent remote patient monitoring, and 21 percent precision medicine.“What stands out here is the increasing importance of telehealth as a different form of access as well as a different form of connecting with consumers,” said Brian Kalis, managing director of the health practice at research and consulting firm Accenture. “Seeing telehealth with increased importance can help address labor productivity challenges in healthcare.”“This foreshadows what we might see accelerate in 2017 – the focus on precision medicine and the initial investments in using precision medicine to improve care,” he said. “This is an early stage trend. As well as the survey respondents’ fairly high prioritization of smart medical devices; we’ve heard from a number of health systems looking at new strategies to use patient-generated health data to improve care.”2017 will be no different than years past with healthcare organizations will be working on their electronic health records. But the priorities for 2017 are unique to the time. Asked which types of EHR development projects are or will be in the works within their enterprises in 2017, 60 percent of survey respondents said improving interoperability, 55 percent improving workflow, 47 percent improving usability, 37 percent adding population health tools to the EHR, 28 percent migrating to the cloud, 24 percent performing a major EHR system upgrade, and 21 percent replacing the EHR at one or more sites.“When you look at the quality programs and MIPS and MACRA, suddenly you are seeing a realignment of incentives where doctors are paid for wellness and quality as opposed to quantity,” he said. “Unless you are collecting data about patients across the population, it’s really hard to control expenses, enhance quality and improve workflow. EHRs were put in basically as dumb data communication systems without emphasis on exchange and workflow. But because of payment reform, we have incentives to do data exchange. Different things are bubbling to the top.”One aspect of EHRs many healthcare organizations continue to work on is caregiver acceptance. Asked what actions will they take in 2017 to get more physicians and nurses to fully embrace EHR technology, 60 percent of survey respondents said integrate EHRs with other technologies that, for example, advance population health or best practices, 47 percent improve EHR system interfaces, 40 percent clearly show EHRs help the organization profitably manage value-based care, and 38 percent clearly show how the technology markedly reduces time spent on tasks outside of direct patient interaction.The “2017: The Year Ahead in Health IT” survey found population health to be a high priority with a great many healthcare organizations. Asked if their organization plans to implement a population health system in 2017, 20 percent of survey respondents said yes, they are planning to deploy a new system, a big 42 percent said yes, they will be adding tools to existing systems, 9 percent said no, they have finished their population health project, and a significant 29 percent said no, population health is not in their plans for 2017.Healthcare organizations working with population health technology anticipate the tech will help their organizations in various ways. According to the survey, 58 percent said the technology will help enable a better patient experience, 54 percent said it will enhance the efficiency with which the organization can deliver healthcare, 51 percent said it will help reduce healthcare costs, 44 percent said it will improve the health of individuals and thus the population, and 41 percent said it will help enable a better provider experience.“There are many early adopters that have population health systems in place and for them there now is a need to enhance the systems and optimize them to integrate them into other systems, hence the increased focus on adding to existing systems in the survey,” said Kalis of Accenture. “For organizations that are launching a new population health system, these are the organizations lagging behind some of the others to get their first implementations in place and thus increase overall market adoption.”On the extremely important cybersecurity front, application security and network security top the list of areas of focus for 2017, according to the survey. Following are security issues healthcare organizations face in 2017, the percent of survey respondents that leans toward labeling the issues a lower priority, the percent that labels the issues smack in the middle on the priority scale, and the percent that leans toward labeling the issues a higher priority, the survey found (totals may not add up to 100% due to rounding):Like cybersecurity, interoperability is a major subject of concern for healthcare organizations. According to the survey, interoperability projects healthcare organizations will be working on in 2017 include connecting to external databases, such as health information exchanges (65 percent); connecting applications within the organization (58 percent); and adding connections from medical devices to existing systems (37 percent).Asked to identify the single biggest inhibitor to greater interoperability in 2017, 40 percent of survey respondents said a lack of industrywide standards, 27 percent EHR vendors, 18 percent a culture of data hoarding, 12 percent financial concerns, and 3 percent other issues.“I have never seen information blocking when there is a combination of a business case for sharing information and competent technical people,” he said. “I only see it when there is a lack of alignment to share data. The data standards we have today are quite sufficient and EHRs are quite sufficient. Meaningful use gave us the standards and interoperability constructs. It’s just the motivation to move forward.”One of the biggest areas of investment in health IT appears to be analytics. Asked about their analytics plans for 2017, 24 percent of healthcare organizations said they are planning to launch a new analytics system, 59 percent are adding tools to existing analytics systems, only 8 percent have completed their analytics deployment, and a mere 9 percent do not have analytics in their 2017 plans, according to the Healthcare IT News survey.Of those organizations working with analytics, 76 percent expect analytics technology will help improve the quality of healthcare, 67 percent expect it will help enhance the ways in which care is delivered, 62 percent expect it will help reduce healthcare costs, 52 percent expect it will help successfully manage the shift from fee-for-service care to value-based care, 30 percent expect it will help free up time for caregivers to spend with patients, and 1 percent does not use analytics, according to the survey.“The consistent trend across many of these technology categories, including analytics and population health, is that larger organizations have put in place the first wave of solutions, this already has happened,” said Kalis of Accenture. “Now, these organizations are optimizing their investments and adding to them to maximize the value of the foundation already in place.”Looking forward, healthcare organizations have a variety of emerging technologies in the pipeline. Asked which emerging technologies they are planning to invest in during 2017, 63 percent of survey respondents said prescriptive analytics, 34 percent artificial intelligence, 21 percent genomics tools, 21 percent machine learning, 19 percent cognitive computing, and 6 percent Blockchain.Further, when asked which emerging technologies they consider to have the most promise, 26 percent of survey respondents said prescriptive analytics, 22 percent genomics tools, 18 percent artificial intelligence, 13 percent machine learning, 10 percent cognitive computing, and 4 percent Blockchain.“Prescriptive analytics is right on the money, which ties in with some of the artificial intelligence and machine learning, the things we do to look at the volume of information we have collected,” said Fisne of Geisinger Health System. “The data gives us a lot of the patterns and information, and by seeing those you see ways to provide better patient care.”“Health systems have invested in putting some of the foundational building blocks of analytics in place; the emerging technology here, prescriptive analytics, is the next step of trying to derive insights from the information and foundational assets in place,” Kalis said. “Also interesting from this list is the fact that Blockchain is even on the radar of some CIOs; it’s telling that there is interest in exploration to understand where Blockchain platforms can be applied and what the implications can be long term.”","A year-end poll from Black Book Market Research – which surveyed healthcare CEOs, CIOs and CFOs – predicts an uncertain year ahead for health IT as political, financial, clinical and business questions come into focus and shape hospital decision making.Technology budgets should remain flat in 2017, according to Black Book, which finds that a substantial majority (77 percent) of hospital IT decision makers forecast sluggish spending and staffing at least through Q1 and Q2 ot the year. Physician practices, meanwhile, report expecting an average 13 percent decrease in their budgets.Nearly all (94 percent) of hospitals of 200 beds or fewer say they're not adequately capturing the information necessary for actionable population health analytics. Manging all that patient info requires a data warehouse. Seventy-two percent of financial executives recognize that their electronic health records are producing reports but aren't giving the results they need to achieve complex risk modeling, and need EDWs to do it, according to Black Book. But even those hospitals with the technology installed (81 percent of them) say they still have challenges adequately storing and managing EHR, financial data, labor and supply chain data.Eighty-five percent of hospitals with fewer than 200 beds say they've so far avoided full implementations, upgrades and enhancements of their ERP capabilities in recent years, says Black Book. But 93 percent of CFOs say price transparency, supply chain efficiencies and value-based care necessitate full investments in ERP.Eighty-five percent of hospitals with siloed EHR networks don't expect much enhancements in interoperability in 2017, according to Black Book, and even more (88 percent) of CIOs of hospitals with more than 100 beds and decreasing margins say funding just isn't budgeted in 2017 to enable improvements in data exchange.The vast majority (95 percent) of hospitals with more than 200 beds say they're girded for big cyber attacks in 2017. But even so, they say they're not ready, from a technology perspective, to deal with them: along with insufficient threat detection (reported by 82 percent of respondents in hospitals with fewer than 400 beds), \"traditional tools have contributed to alert fatigue by excessively warning about activities that may not be indicative of a real security incident,\" according to the Black Book report.More than half (55 percent) of CIOs tell Black Book that they're confident in their cloud application strategies. But many providers still haven't yet invested in cloud storage for disaster recovery (83 percent). That number could change in 2017.\"Accuracy in pre-service, registration, timely capture of referrals, authorizations, and point of service financial clearance procedures will be key to improving downstream cash flow while decreasing the amount of rework and cost to collect,\" according to Black Book, based on feedback from CFOs. \"Middle office functions such as coding and clinical documentation improvement initiatives will be recognized as critical functions in favorable revenue cycle performance.\"Market value for IT professionals for expertise in healthcare analytics, security, big data, and cloud applications has risen nearly 25 percent in 2016 already, according to the report. Moreover: \"healthcare companies that rely on foreign workers through the H-1B programs may see new policies restricting the use of this provision that could limit the supply of talent, increase the cost of talent, or both.\"Precision medicine is exciting, but providers tell Black Book that it's \"very hard to implement.\" Even with digitized patient records, genomics requires \"fine-toothed data that most hospitals simply don't have.\" Its advice for tacking personalized care? \"Go back and address issues 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 before proceeding.\"","I read this article and found it very interesting, thought it might be something for you. The article is called 7 Healthcare Trends to Watch in 2017and is located athttp://hitconsultant.net/2017/01/09/7-healthcare-trends-to-watch-in-2017/.2017 is here! As much as the last year was packed with surprises for the healthcare industry, a lot of them are expected this year too. President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office, the 21st Century Cures Act is law and MACRA redefines the terms of the healthcare industry. Many will concur, we are headed for significant changes in this year. As 2017 comes, here are some major things to look forward in US healthcare space:MACRA has been, by far, one of the most significant federal legislation in US healthcare space. Physicians and payers alike believe MACRA to be transformative, overhauling the way providers will get paid in America. Since this is going to be the first performance year for Merit-Based Incentive Payment System under MACRA, it is important that physicians are educated, aware, and understand the gaps between what they already do, and what MACRA requires them to do. Although MACRA was supposed to take fully-fledged effect from the start of 2017, CMS has delayed its full implementation and has permitted practices to participate partially in 2017.  Major concerns regarding MACRA:Repealing and replacing ACA was one of President-elect Donald Trump’s top priorities. However, as the complete repeal of ACA might not be the best idea due to various reasons. Donald Trump after meeting President Obama has taken a soft tone for ACA, but debating is on whether to repeal it or amend it according to GOP’s plan. The fate of Obamacare is still unclear. People are eager to learn about:Lately, there have been several developments in technologies such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and wearable technologies that have not only been disruptive but also have the potential to change the face of healthcare in 2017 and transform the vision of population health management. Healthcare veterans believe that the road to population health is an unpaved but a long one, and is bigger than anything else. It needs:There have been many regulatory and reimbursement changes for pharmaceutical companies lately, and with the onset of a new presidential term, there would be much more. At times like this, pharmaceutical companies are aiming towards engaging patients to ensure that they are providing the best possible value, combined with sharing of information among themselves and with the patients. Over years, pharmaceutical companies have increased their spending in advertising from $3.83 billion to $5.4 billion and were rewarded by an increase in sales from $328 billion to $413 billion. Also, the new federal administration has assured people of several drug reforms, including their import. Moreover, to build trust with patients, healthcare providers, and health insurance companies; drug companies may restrict frequent increases in drug prices. 2016 was dotted with news of partnerships and collaborations in healthcare, presenting the importance of working together to survive the shift to value-based reimbursement. 2017 will witness a growth in partnerships, along with joint ventures, mergers, acquisitions, strategic alliances and clinical affiliations as well – with a joint goal to shift from pay-for-service to pay-for-performance. Whether value-based care is being achieved through an analytics-driven approach, new payment models or changes in federal regulations, the ultimate goal is to provide higher quality with lower costs that makes use of robust infrastructure and complete clinical skills to provide care services. This is, and will remain the essence of healthcare services. We are charging headlong into the future, marching towards a new, different world. Healthcare industries need to adapt to these changes driving towards value in innovative ways and setting them as building blocks for upcoming changes. There may be some variables, fate of some issues uncertain; but this year has come with a million opportunities with the aim to deliver the best health outcomes.I read this article and found it very interesting, thought it might be something for you. The article is called 7 Healthcare Trends to Watch in 2017and is located athttp://hitconsultant.net/2017/01/09/7-healthcare-trends-to-watch-in-2017/.","Healthcare reform is spreading across the globe. And while “reform” differs depending on the city, country and region, the foundational realities driving reform are similar throughout the world: the spiraling costs of care; our aging and growing populations; and the emergence of worldwide epidemic conditions, such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and cancer.Wherever in the world I travel, I find a deep belief and intuitive sense that the incorporation into our evolving healthcare models of “smart” information and communications technology (ICT) will support our global drive to achieve consistent, sustainable, high quality, cost-efficient healthcare. However, the initial attempts at healthcare reform in the United States should serve as acautionary tale to health leaders in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and elsewhere; the US-legislated ICT-based reform – guided by visions of rapid advancement to high value care – has violently collided with operational realities. Learning from “what is going right” and “what is going wrong” in the American reform process may allow health leaders around the world to select realistic, impactful ICT investments in 2017 and beyond.Your country is preparing to build a massive, integrated, railway system to serve every city, town and community across the nation. This will take years and require massive amounts of money and human capital to complete. In order to avoid wasting money, time and labor, it is critical that you adopt an intelligent, informed construction strategy. So before you spend money buying a train, you should spend money, time and labor building train stations and laying down train tracks connecting those train stations.Creating and building a better healthcare system anywhere in the world is a massive undertaking requiring years, enormous amounts of money, and significant human resources to complete (and then maintain). In our railway analogy, big data and clinical analytics are the train. The time will come when investing in these powerful ICT systems and tools will allow for a great leap forward in delivering high value healthcare. But before spending valuable, limited resources on this healthcare ICT train, government and healthcare leaders should first invest in building “health ICT train stations” and connecting these stations by laying down “health ICT train tracks” across their cities, states, territories and nations. It is these “health ICT train stations” and “health ICT train tracks” that must be the major ICT trends beginning in 2017.Now, another word of warning based on the US healthcare reform experience: buying EHRs from a variety of commercial vendors makes affordable, successful communication across cities, states and countries much less likely, as differing EHRs are often unable to adequately communicate with one another. In our railway example, this is like building train stations that cannot all service the same size trains. Healthcare systems, cities, states and nations that have purchased a variety of EHR systems (as in the US and some other countries) are now spending vast amounts of money either abandoning and replacing their initial EHRs or investing significantly more money, time and personnel buying and implementing inter-ware to enable communication between their differing EHR systems. So as healthcare leaders and governments invest in EHRs and connecting ICT in 2017, they should seriously attempt to purchase their ICT solutions from a single vendor or a limited number of vendors with experience in (or at least an open commitment to) network integration and communication.The US experience has shown us that it takes years to build our ICT health train stations and ICT health tracks. Investing too early in trains (big data and clinical analytics) is costly and inefficient. Fortunately, there is one significant and favorable difference between healthcare systems and railway systems: simply implementing an EHR in a single hospital can improve the quality, safety and cost-of-care for thousands of patients; next, integrating even a limited number of EHRs can dramatically expand that high-value care. In other words, unlike a railway system, investing in EHRs and integration ICT in 2017 will immediately deliver value to patients, providers and payers. … We don’t have to wait for the trains.The HIMSS-Elsevier Digital Healthcare Awards is a global platform established in 2013 to recognize outstanding thought leadership in the use of health information and technology to advance patient care and safety. Awards are granted in three categories: Outstanding ICT Achievement, Outstanding ICT Innovation, and Outstanding ROI Achievement.\nDr. Edelstein was in private practice for several years before serving on the surgical faculty at Stanford University, where he focused on gastrointestinal, oncologic and trauma surgery.
