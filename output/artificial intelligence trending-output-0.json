["","","Moving beyond a back-end tool for the enterprise, artificial intelligence (AI) is taking on more sophisticated roles within technology interfaces. From autonomous driving vehicles that use computer vision, to live translations made possible by machine learning, AI is making every interface both simple and smart–and setting a high bar for how future experiences will work.In deploying contextual intelligence to an interface to make it truly intuitive, companies should aim to make the technology it’s supporting disappear. That opens doors to greater adoption of complicated tools, just by providing access to them through a simpler AI-enabled experience. Put simply, invisible technology gets more use.Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Using this approach, a computer can, say, figure out how to navigate a maze by trial and error and then associate the positive outcome—exiting the maze—with the actions that led up to it. This lets a machine learn without instruction or even explicit examples. The idea has been around for decades, but combining it with large (or deep) neural networks provides the power needed to make it work on really complex problems (like the game of Go). Through relentless experimentation, as well as analysis of previous games, AlphaGo figured out for itself how play the game at an expert level.This may also be the year in which China starts looking like a major player in the field of AI. The country’s tech industry is shifting away from copying Western companies, and it has identified AI and machine learning as the next big areas of innovation.Ask AI researchers what their next big target is, and they are likely to mention language. The hope is that techniques that have produced spectacular progress in voice and image recognition, among other areas, may also help computers parse and generate language more effectively.One real problem is that hype inevitably leads to a sense of disappointment when big breakthroughs don’t happen, causing overvalued startups to fail and investment to dry up. Perhaps 2017 will feature some sort of backlash against the AI hype machine—and maybe that wouldn’t be such a bad thing.","","According to recent PwC research, global GDP could be up to 14% higher in 2030 as a result of new artificial intelligence technologies – the equivalent of an additional $15.7 trillion – making it the biggest commercial opportunity in today’s fast changing economy. The financial services sector could be one of the biggest winners from this, with large scale improvements in the delivery of products and services.AI has the potential to transform our lives, so much so that Stanford Professor Andrew Ng believes that as these AI innovations penetrate more industries, AI will become like electricity to our civilization in the next 10 to 20 years, involved in all aspects of our existence.For the financial services industry, competing with new digital entrants requires responsible adoption of machine learning and robotic process automation technology throughout their organizations far more quickly than they traditionally embrace innovation. In order to succeed in this new digital world, the financial services industry must position itself as driving innovation in the distribution of products and services to effectively compete.Beyond what’s already being applied on the ground, artificial intelligence can help banks, insurance companies, credit and finance firms and asset management companies reimagine and restructure operating models and processes. Large institutions must process huge volumes of data to generate financial reports and satisfy regulatory and compliance requirements. These processes are increasingly standardized and formulaic, but still involve large numbers of people performing low-value-added tasks (often in reconciliation and consolidation), making them ideal candidates for robotic process automation. Such automation could yield massive operational efficiencies that will redound to the consumer.Back offices now develop bots that do simple, repeatable work so humans don’t have to. Fraud departments assisted by deep learning technology can quickly discern the difference between true red flags and false positives. Lending decisions are increasingly assisted by some form of artificial intelligence.Some say that all we are accomplishing is the automation of repetitive tasks that improve operational efficiency rather than implementing innovations that could perform roughly as a human. AI and machine learning scholars continue research to achieve what they refer to as strong AI with humanlike capabilities and beyond, but those significant breakthroughs could be a little farther away.Regardless of the differing perspectives, each time we see a significant increase in interest in new AI innovations, the yield is planet-altering benefits of major technological advances that improve our lives. Examples include the development of the internet, mobile phones and now blockchain technologies. Each of those technologies arose from a period of increasing interest in AI technological research.To realize the opportunity of AI, financial institutions must develop strategies that put people at the center and commit to develop responsible systems that are aligned to moral and ethical values that will drive positive outcomes for consumers. Importantly, FIs should follow trends without getting bamboozled by the “next big thing.”Financial services firms should prepare for increased consumer interest in AI and plot their course in regards to this emerging technology carefully. Appropriate development and use of AI should improve the customer experience and efficiency of the firm. Companies that embrace this trend are likely to be the winners of the future.The Financial Services Roundtable connects banks, insurance companies, asset managers and credit card companies with futurists and leading technology companies to explore the impact of innovation on our businesses and our customers."]
