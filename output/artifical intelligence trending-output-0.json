["","James Paine is a real estate entrepreneur, investor and blogger based in San Diego, California. After dropping out of college at age 20, he launched West Realty Advisors, an investment fund that has purchased and flipped over 1,500 properties across the United States.A fully developed, self-teaching AI unit is no longer a dream, it has transitioned into an inevitability with the only real question being \"who will get their first?\" There have been so many artificial intelligence breakthroughs in recent years, it can be difficult to imagine what's next.One of the major challenges that has constantly plagued both AI and the world of computing in general is natural language use. If you've ever had to use a voice-activated telephone system or tried to write a computer program, you know what I'm talking about. Computers accept instructions using a very specific set of commands and subtleties like tone or \"figures of speech\" are completely lost on them.Sarcasm, wordplay, and similar nuances aside, the other major challenge facing AI is the ability to recognize human emotion. A chatbot that can recognize when a person is getting frustrated and adjust its tactics accordingly will go a long way towards improving customer relations. The potential of such a breakthrough goes well beyond the business world though.Alongside AI, big data has been one of the most overhyped (and least understood) terms of the past few years. While the business potential that lies in big data analytics is enormous, the challenge of properly analyzing that data and drawing relevant conclusions is just as big. As AI and machine learning techniques develop, it will completely revolutionize the way we interact with big data.As AI progresses and is entrusted with more important tasks, the question of liability is weighing heavily on the minds of everyone in the industry. If an artificial intelligence unit commits a crime, who is responsible? Is it the company who purchased the unit, the business(or person) that developed it, or most interestingly, will the unit itself be held responsible? Let's take a moment to focus on that last option.If an AI bot is deemed responsible for its own crime, how do you punish it? Most people will immediately conclude, destroy it, simple. But, if an AI unit is so advanced that it can be held accountable and punished for its actions, is it not so advanced that it deserves some basic rights? Businesses in the US and many other countries are recognized as their own legal entity with a complete list of rights and responsibilities. By that logic, it would seem that at some point AI bots will need the same regulations put in place.If you've spent much time reading about AI over the past few years, I wouldn't blame you for feeling like bots will either take over the world or solve all of our problems in the next decade. All menial jobs are going to disappear and the human race will devolve into a scene from Wall-E. However, the truth is far less exciting.While it's true that there have been major developments in AI over the past decade, the industry still is very much in its infancy. I'm not saying that bots won't replace more jobs and I'm not even denying they could one day \"rule the world.\" However, the chances either of robots taking over or solving all the world's problems in our lifetime are laughably slim. As we get used to interacting with AI and develop a better understanding of it, the hype will begin to fade and the conversation will move to real problems like liability, instead of hysterical nonsense like robots taking over.  ","","Artificial Intelligence (AI) remained the driving force of various industries in 2017. With so many tech giants and startups already delving into the AI ecosystem, it is expected to grow with better use cases in the year 2018. Considering the acceptance, development, and applications of AI, here we are with significant opportunities and perils that this ingenious technology will put forth in 2018.AI in the form of machine learning, deep learning, computer vision etc. enable developers to build intelligent apps. Some of the examples that exhibits and justify AI integration of apps  includes abstraction of big data, enabling recommendations, smart search, fraud detection, healthcare and fitness management etc. In the following year, we could see expansion in use cases and result in productive intelligent apps, without developers being explicitly coding for it.Chatbots are another use case of Artificial Intelligence that developers can put to use. Bots are not just facilitating individuals to get anytime support but also helping businesses in augmenting their customer support and utilize human intelligence for more productive tasks.. According to IBM, 65% of Generation Y prefers interacting to bots. In June 2017, Facebook announced 11,000 bots for Messengers. With such great numbers and positive response, we could see bots becoming the frontrunner of customer service industry in the following time.In the year 2018, we could have Intelligent Things ruling, an artistic intersection of Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence. So basically, what these intelligent things do is they use AI and ML to interact with the surrounding or people, in an intelligent manner. Or, they can make the existing things intelligent. Example: Turning camera into smart camera or using fitness tracker to not only monitor health but analyzing the user routine (using machine learning) to recommend changes for improving health or avoid risk.One of the various industries that are disrupted by Artificial Intelligence is Healthcare. Making the most of AI applications like cognitive learning, big data management, deep learning, healthcare industry is pulling off a number of diagnosis, treatment, and research processes., the healthcare market is projected to reach 6.6 billion by 2021. Big brands like IBM (Watson, Medical Seive), Google (Deepmind Health), Atomwise (Drug discovery with AI) are heavily investing in Artificial Intelligence to put forth the finest healthcare solutions. And considering the scope that AI brings in, a number of startups are pulling out the best from AI and will continue to grow in time to come.Artificial Intelligence has made us believe in future where complex decisions can be taken faster, automatically through learned experiences. And this is not just possible with the software applications. In the following time, we could see hardware industry paying more attention to AI and its applications.In Oct 2017, Intel announced about Nervana Neural Network Processor family of chips that is specially designed for Artificial Intelligence use cases. These chips will be shipped by the end of this year. Also, the year 2017 has seen brands and individual developers working on a number of projects that are powered by AI, which includes bit is not limited to drones ( that over 3,510 companies with 2,562 investors, and 4.9 million average pre-money valuation are listed there. And in the recent past, we have seen tech names like Intel, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon taking over a number of smart AI startups. We can expect this to be followed up in the year 2018, with startups fetching an attractive funding.However, if the the applications of AI are perceived well, this ingenious technology will augment the human jobs, instead of replacing it. And to be precise, the impact of AI on human workforce will be dependent upon the type of job. For example: If you are a customer service executive, intelligent chatbots might serve your purpose to a business. However, with AI, we can see augmentation in jobs like data scientists, robot monitoring, automation monitoring etc.Content strategist by profession and blogger by passion, Archna is avid about updating herself with the freshest dose of technology and sharing them with the readers. Stay tuned here as she brings some trending stories from the tech-territory of mobile and web. ","We also describe in the Tech Vision how AI will, in time, become the digital spokesperson for leading enterprises. Customers will experience a company’s brand through personalized, 100 percent consistent and natural interactions with AI service agents—and even engage with the brand through other companies’ AI interfaces. This post highlights how we see this tech trend unfolding.AI technology is already taking a larger role in user experiences across various interfaces. Think of people’s conversations with chat bots on the web, their mobile phone queries to Google Now, and their requests to Alexa on an Amazon Echo speaker at home. In each of these examples, people are interacting with technology through an AI intermediator. This is a much more natural, intuitive way to relate to technology. In fact, we’re starting to treat technology like we treat each other. So instead of accessing a website to find information or a mobile app to complete tasks, we’re talking to the AI, making decisions with it, and getting what we need and want through it.This is an absolute game-changer. The slew of artificial intelligence technologies—natural language processing, computer vision, machine learning, intelligent automation, robotic process automation, deep learning and more—will fundamentally alter our relationship with technology. This changing relationship will have major ramifications for how digital businesses build systems. And it will unlock many new opportunities to help customers and employees accomplish their personal and professional goals in their lives and at work.Natural, more human-like interactions with technology are becoming the new normal. Think about your satisfaction when an AI intermediator understands a request…and your frustration when it doesn’t. As intelligent enterprises integrate AI technologies into their systems, customers and employees will expect even more from these interactions. As artificial intelligence becomes people’s “go-to” technology, it will require enterprises to step up to a new challenge: creating responsible AI. This not only has business implications, but also individual and societal implications. AI will be successful only if it’s adopted by people, and it will only be successful it if helps provide better outcomes for people and society. Our theme for Tech Vision 2017 is Technology for People. Companies are more reliant on their employees than ever before and more susceptible to what customers think. Therefore, companies must be extremely smart about how they implement AI. In addition, they should make AI technologies highly accessible and transparent. Giving customers and employees opportunities to interact with the AI (via a machine, robot, device, etc.) will help them to better understand what the technology is doing and how it’s enabling them to reach their goals. ","Despite the early successes, however, there’s no clear path for businesses intent on capitalizing on AI. Like any emerging technology, there are a number of considerations and challenges your organization must work through. That’s where our short list comes in: 10 tips you’ll need to get things right. We’ve identified the key business issues you should understand and address. In a future post, we’ll look at the top tech trends that we expect will shape the AI market in the coming year and inform the techniques and tools your data scientists and AI leaders should deploy.Ultimately, you want to take a portfolio approach that might include several quick-win projects as well as one or two that are more complex but have significant potential. This emphasis on “practical” AI is one we expect to see a lot of in the coming year. At the AI Summit, Nvidia’s Brian Catanzaro illustrated this approach. While the company is known as an AI powerhouse thanks to its graphics processing units and AI software tools, Catanzaro, Nvidia’s VP of applied deep learning, talked about how the company is also using AI in less glamorous areas like quality control and resume matching. Likewise, JD.com, the largest retailer in China, not only showcased the more exotic ways it is using AI, drones, and robotics in its warehouses and delivery, but Hui Cheng, head of robotics R&D, also talked about AI’s application in more mundane areas like inventory management, advertising, and pricing.One thing that came across loud and clear at the conference was the importance of functional and other business specialists as you develop AI solutions tailored to your organization. These are the people in the trenches who have the knowledge and expertise about your business processes, pain points, and data. They’re also the ones who will help shape solutions and drive adoption.Fedex Data Scientist Clayton Clouse drove this point home when talking about the key role that operations managers played in the development, testing, and roll-out of a solution that optimized truck inventory. We think of this trend as the third wave of AI in the enterprise. It started with data as a key advantage. The second wave was all about creating AI platforms using Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure. And now this new wave will center on vertically focused AI led by domain experts.Getting a handle on your organization’s data has been front and center for some time now. But AI raises the stakes because it adds another layer of complexity beyond the already formidable challenges of gathering disparate data—including the mushrooming amount of unstructured data that lives outside of the rigid confines of a database—and prepping it for analysis. With supervised machine learning, where humans train and tune the algorithm, you not only need very large data sets, but they also must be labeled so that the model can “learn” to identify the correct outcome. For even a simple model, labeling might take 30 seconds per label; if you have 10,000 pieces of data, that amounts to about 100 hours of work. Some companies outsource the work of labeling or use open source or crowdsourced data that has already been labeled. Looking outside your enterprise will also become more important as you begin to think about the broader data ecosystem in your industry, such as the partners, customers, regulators, and other entities that are part of your data flows.As with any technology solution, one that uses AI will only be successful if customers, patients, employees, and other users adopt it. This requires understanding the user experience—how people interact with the system and/or its outputs. One way to put people first is by applying design thinking or similar approaches that focus on the user journey and identify how and where technology can improve it. Sometimes the surprising answer might be that AI isn’t needed; the solution may be a process change or a simpler technology. On the other hand, it might also reveal a bigger problem that AI can help solve. Putting the user first might be something as seemingly simple as what Kal Mos, VP of R&D at Mercedes-Benz shared about designing the new S class. First, Mercedes-Benz asked drivers if it was OK with them for the car to suggest a destination. This put drivers in control and helped to establish trust in the AI-enabled car.Other new terminology you’ll need to learn and think about has to do with how you calculate the return on investment (ROI) for AI. In our panel at the AI Summit on pragmatic, practical, and measurable AI, we focused on the need for two kinds of metrics: the traditional ones by which you’d gauge any business investment (for example, revenue increases, claims processed, service requests resolved), as well as ones that capture new kinds of value. For example, you might look at automated full-time equivalents (AFEs) as automation takes on discrete tasks or business processes and frees up human workers. Or you might look at less tangible returns, such as increased confidence in an outcome or the additional options an AI solution provides, such as different ways to explore strategy (see #9).","Reinforcement learning takes inspiration from the ways that animals learn how certain behaviors tend to result in a positive or negative outcome. Using this approach, a computer can, say, figure out how to navigate a maze by trial and error and then associate the positive outcome—exiting the maze—with the actions that led up to it. This lets a machine learn without instruction or even explicit examples. The idea has been around for decades, but combining it with large (or deep) neural networks provides the power needed to make it work on really complex problems (like the game of Go). Through relentless experimentation, as well as analysis of previous games, AlphaGo figured out for itself how play the game at an expert level.This may also be the year in which China starts looking like a major player in the field of AI. The country’s tech industry is shifting away from copying Western companies, and it has identified AI and machine learning as the next big areas of innovation.Ask AI researchers what their next big target is, and they are likely to mention language. The hope is that techniques that have produced spectacular progress in voice and image recognition, among other areas, may also help computers parse and generate language more effectively.One real problem is that hype inevitably leads to a sense of disappointment when big breakthroughs don’t happen, causing overvalued startups to fail and investment to dry up. Perhaps 2017 will feature some sort of backlash against the AI hype machine—and maybe that wouldn’t be such a bad thing.","Investors beware: there's plenty buzz around artificial intelligence (AI) as more and more companies say they're using it. In some cases, companies are using older data analytics tools and labeling it as AI for a public relations boost. But identifying companies actually getting material revenue growth from AI can be tricky.Notice: Information contained herein is not and should not be construed as an offer, solicitation, or recommendation to buy or sell securities.

It has the power to completely change how we live, work and get around. If electricity and the internet changed humanity forever in the 20th century, then AI will in the 21st. It’s predicted that AI will bring a massive shift in how people perceive and interact with technology, with machines performing a greater and greater number of tasks and, in many cases, doing a better job of it than humans.By its simplest definition, AI is an umbrella term for technologies that are inspired by biological systems that give computers human-like abilities related to seeing, reasoning, hearing, and learning. Today, artificial intelligence technology encompasses things like machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), machine reasoning, deep learning, and computer vision. It’s wise to think of this definition as fluid. What is considered AI today, once adopted, will be commonplace, no longer considered AI. So let’s have a look at the trends that will see 2017 one of the greatest years of progress yet.Conitzer sees interest in AI reaching groups outside of the industry. Lawyers will start to grapple with how laws should deal with autonomous vehicles; economists will study AI-driven technological unemployment; sociologists will study the impact of AI-human relationships. This is the world of the future.By all accounts, 2017 won’t be the year for large, general-purpose AI systems. Instead, there will be an explosion of specific, highly niche artificial intelligence technology systems. These include autonomous vehicles (cars and drones), robotics, bots (consumer-orientated such as Amazon Echo and personal assistants), and industry specific AI (think finance, health, security etc.).It was way back in 1967 that the prediction was made by an American-based tech laboratory: “Within a generation, the problem of creating artificial intelligence will be all but solved.”. While it’s too soon to call the prediction prescient, progress is being made. Here are a few examples:Most AI systems are immensely complex sponges that absorb data and process it at tremendous rates. The risks related to AI ethics, security and privacy are real and need to be addressed through consideration and consensus. Sure, it’s unlikely that these problems will be solved in 2017, but as long as the conversation around these topics continues, we can expect at least some headway.","Artificial intelligence has been the top buzz word in IT this year, and the heavy focus on AI will continue next year, as organizations embrace AI as a differentiator in better driving business processes, engaging customers and increasing revenue.This week, Gartner Inc. presented its list of the top strategic technology trends that will impact most organizations in 2018, during the Gartner Symposium/ITxpo, which was held in Orlando through yesterday. Gartner defines a strategic technology trend as “one with substantial disruptive potential that is beginning to break out of an emerging state into broader impact and use, or which are rapidly growing trends with a high degree of volatility reaching tipping points over the next five years.”The Gartner top 10 list – “The Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends for 2018” - was delivered at the ITxpo by David Clearley, vice president and Gartner Fellow. In his keynote address, Clearley cautioned that \"IT leaders must factor these technology trends into their innovation strategies or risk losing ground to those that do.\"The next four trends focus on blending the digital and physical worlds to create an immersive, digitally enhanced environment. The last three refer to exploiting connections between an expanding set of people and businesses, as well as devices, content and services to deliver digital business outcomes.Creating systems that learn, adapt and potentially act autonomously will be a major battleground for technology vendors through at least 2020, Clearley said. The ability to use AI to enhance decision making, reinvent business models and ecosystems, and remake the customer experience will drive the payoff for digital initiatives through 2025.\"AI techniques are evolving rapidly and organizations will need to invest significantly in skills, processes and tools to successfully exploit these techniques and build AI-enhanced systems,\" Cearley said. \"Investment areas can include data preparation, integration, algorithm and training methodology selection, and model creation. Multiple constituencies including data scientists, developers and business process owners will need to work together.\"Over the next few years, virtually every app, application and service will incorporate some level of AI, Gartner believes. Some of these apps will be obvious intelligent apps that could not exist without AI and machine learning. Others will be unobtrusive users of AI that provide intelligence behind the scenes. Intelligent apps create a new intelligent intermediary layer between people and systems and have the potential to transform the nature of work and the structure of the workplace.\"Explore intelligent apps as a way of augmenting human activity and not simply as a way of replacing people,\" Cearley said. \"Augmented analytics is a particularly strategic growing area which uses machine learning to automate data preparation, insight discovery and insight sharing for a broad range of business users, operational workers and citizen data scientists.\"AI has become the next major battleground in a wide range of software and service markets, including aspects of enterprise resource planning, Clearley explains. Packaged software and service providers should outline how they'll be using AI to add business value in new versions in the form of advanced analytics, intelligent processes and advanced user experiences.Intelligent things are physical things that go beyond the execution of rigid programming models to exploit AI to deliver advanced behaviors and interact more naturally with their surroundings and with people, Clearley explains. AI is driving advances for new intelligent things (such as autonomous vehicles, robots and drones) and delivering enhanced capability to many existing things (such as Internet of Things [IoT] connected consumer and industrial systems).A digital twin refers to the digital representation of a real-world entity or system, Gartner explains. “Digital twins in the context of IoT projects is particularly promising over the next three to five years and is leading the interest in digital twins today,” according to Gartner. “Well-designed digital twins of assets have the potential to significantly improve enterprise decision making. These digital twins are linked to their real-world counterparts and are used to understand the state of the thing or system, respond to changes, improve operations and add value.”Organizations will implement digital twins simply at first, but then evolve them over time, improving their ability to collect and visualize the right data, apply the right analytics and rules, and respond effectively to business objectives, Gartner believes.\"Over time, digital representations of virtually every aspect of our world will be connected dynamically with their real-world counterpart and with one another and infused with AI-based capabilities to enable advanced simulation, operation and analysis,\" Cearley said. \"City planners, digital marketers, healthcare professionals and industrial planners will all benefit from this long-term shift to the integrated digital twin world.\"Edge computing describes a computing topology in which information processing, and content collection and delivery, are placed closer to the sources of this information, Gartner says. Connectivity and latency challenges, bandwidth constraints and greater functionality embedded at the edge favors distributed models. Enterprises should begin using edge design patterns in their infrastructure architectures — particularly for those with significant IoT elements.\"When used as complementary concepts, cloud can be the style of computing used to create a service-oriented model and a centralized control and coordination structure with edge being used as a delivery style allowing for disconnected or distributed process execution of aspects of the cloud service,\" Cearley said.“Conversational platforms will drive the next big paradigm shift in how humans interact with the digital world,” Gartner predicts. “The burden of translating intent shifts from user to computer. The platform takes a question or command from the user and then responds by executing some function, presenting some content or asking for additional input.”Gartner believes the virtual reality and augmented reality market is currently “adolescent and fragmented. Interest is high, resulting in many novelty VR applications that deliver little real business value outside of advanced entertainment, such as video games and 360-degree spherical videos.”Mixed reality, a type of immersion that merges and extends the technical functionality of both AR and VR, is emerging as “the immersive experience of choice providing a compelling technology that optimizes its interface to better match how people view and interact with their world,” Gartner says. “Mixed reality exists along a spectrum and includes head-mounted displays (HMDs) for augmented or virtual reality as well as smartphone and tablet-based AR and use of environmental sensors. Mixed reality represents the span of how people perceive and interact with the digital world.”Blockchain is evolving from a digital currency infrastructure into a platform for digital transformation. Gartner believes blockchain offers “a radical departure from the current centralized transaction and record-keeping mechanisms and can serve as a foundation of disruptive digital business for both established enterprises and startups.”“Although the hype surrounding blockchains originally focused on the financial services industry, blockchains have many potential applications, including government, healthcare, manufacturing, media distribution, identity verification, title registry and supply chain. Although it holds long-term promise and will undoubtedly create disruption, blockchain promise outstrips blockchain reality, and many of the associated technologies are immature for the next two to three years,” the research firm says.“Business events could be anything that is noted digitally, reflecting the discovery of notable states or state changes, for example, completion of a purchase order, or an aircraft landing. With the use of event brokers, IoT, cloud computing, blockchain, in-memory data management and AI, business events can be detected faster and analyzed in greater detail. But technology alone without cultural and leadership change does not deliver the full value of the event-driven model. Digital business drives the need for IT leaders, planners and architects to embrace event thinking.”“To securely enable digital business initiatives in a world of advanced, targeted attacks, security and risk management leaders must adopt a continuous adaptive risk and trust assessment approach to allow real-time, risk and trust-based decision making with adaptive responses. Security infrastructure must be adaptive everywhere, to embrace the opportunity — and manage the risks — that comes delivering security that moves at the speed of digital business,” Gartner says.“As part of a CARTA approach, organizations must overcome the barriers between security teams and application teams, much as DevOps tools and processes overcome the divide between development and operations. Information security architects must integrate security testing at multiple points into DevOps workflows in a collaborative way that is largely transparent to developers, and preserves the teamwork, agility and speed of DevOps and agile development environments, delivering ‘DevSecOps.’” "]
