["Will more devices/platforms be developed that combine the power of AI with VR/AR/MR-related experiences? For example, will students be able to issue a verbal question or command to be able to see and experience walking around ancient Rome? ","Next generation online tools are facilitating student collaboration and  communication, and allowing students to act as creators of knowledge, rather  than just consumers. Collaborative learning models that drive student-centered  learning and emphasize interacting, working in groups, developing solutions to  real-world problems and communicating globally are the latest iteration of this  trend. “If we truly want to prepare our students for the real world, we need to put  them in responsive, dynamic environments that reflect life outside a  traditional classroom,” explains Kayla  Delzer, a third grade teacher at Mapleton Elementary in Mapleton,  North Dakota. “The world is changing,  yet our classrooms are remaining much the same. Revitalizing space is a  straightforward way to let students exercise choice in the learning environment  and find academic success on their own terms.”In 2017, these pedagogical frameworks will engage students in critical  thinking, problem-solving, collaboration and self-directed learning connected to  real-life applications. The thoughtful integration of technology will enable students  to take ownership of their learning and will make learning more active, both inside  and outside the classroom.“This particular movement is not fringe; it’s becoming much more mainstream.  And much like the 1:1 movement, it’s giving us a new lens through which to look  at traditional curriculum. It’s giving us permission and acting as a catalyst  for making changes to teaching.”This trend is based on the recognition that ongoing, embedded professional  development and support from coaches is essential for teachers and administrators to fully understand  how to appropriately and thoughtfully integrate technology and technology  resources.With the spread of the maker movement and the popularity of  robotics comes the rise of coding, coding programs and programming. These  topics are interconnected as many maker activities are run by coding. Look for an  increase in the range of coding activities and programs for students of all  ages, even the youngest learners.Easy access to edtech tools and solutions, ways  to broadly share edtech best practices, methods for disseminating  transformative ideas for advancing educational environments; these are the  strategies that today’s cutting-edge leaders are using.","","THE Journal invited nearly two dozen education leaders to tell us where they thought specific technologies would land on the ed tech thermometer in the coming year. We received 16 responses and interviewed eight of those experts to tell us how they came to their conclusions. Those are the same thoughts we share here. Figuring out just what will captivate educators from one year to the next is a fickle business. The thing everybody was trying one year is on the way out the next. Other movements seem to have the staying power of cork in a bulletin board — always there, always ready for some new take. So it goes forthis year too.\n The use of gaming, flipped learning, banning cell phones and purchasing tablets appear to be waning, while some new movements are definitely waxing. According to the 16 education experts THE Journal conferred with, you'll be hearing a lot more about nine instructional areas in particular: active learning, augmented reality, maker spaces, Next Generation Science Standards, open educational resources, robotics and STEAM, coding and student privacy. Those last two are red hot. Among the nine, only two of those topics surfaced in last year's list too: coding and OER.As the world turns increasingly virtual, movements such as Hour of Code have succeeded in making computer science more accessible to educators and students in every grade, said Kelly Mendoza, who manages the professional development program for Common Sense Media's education programs. \"Teachers are figuring it out. It's a hot topic,\" she noted, conceding, \"It's going to be a while before your everyday teacher is actually shifting to including coding as part of their curriculum.\" Part of the holdup is that coding still comes across as a \"stand-alone thing.\" Her hope is that eventually the act of coding will be viewed as \"a literacy\" and \"ingrained\" in lessons \"just like print literacy or media literacy.\"\nTom Redmon, a teacher at Hamilton School District No. 3 in Montana and a facilitator for LearnZillion, said he thinks the push on STEM has helped build the prominence of coding too. Once a week the students in his fourth grade pull out devices from a Chromebook cart and either practice keyboarding or coding \"or a combination of the two.\" Code.org provides the curriculum he and his fellow teachers use for that. To the kids, he added, \"it's kind of just games.\" But alongside that, \"they are getting a strong coding background.\"\nEven though the topic of coding is also coming up \"in teacher conversation more often,\" Redmon said, adoption isn't moving as fast as he might have expected. \"As with a lot of new innovations, particularly with technology, things seem to be slow to get started. I'm seeing teachers who are really just uncomfortable dipping their feet in. And some of it is generational. Some of it is just the teacher not being willing to put in the time to explore new options.\"\nJeff Knutson, senior manager of education content for Common Sense  Education, sees the subject of coding as something that teachers \"can learn along with their students,\" in a nod to promoting the growth mindset. \"It's a great way for teachers to model for their students how they approach something that's new or unfamiliar.\"","For several years now, innovations in educational technologies (edtech) have impacted how business professionals want to learn. Edtechs such as virtual classrooms, mobile devices, digital readers, on-demand video, online gaming, and cloud-based LMSs have fed a market that has been, and continues to be hungry for innovation. Traditionally, most investment for product innovation in edtech was focused on the higher education market. But recently, investors have looked across the traditional market boundaries beyond higher education and toward corporate training.A key driver for innovation is the adoption rate of new technologies by the millennial community. Millennials entering the job market bring a new set of expectations on how to learn and collaborate. They are teaching leaders of training organizations that learning is best achieved in small ongoing increments, over time, accessed on-demand, using multiple devices, over multiple forms of media. The greatest lesson millennials have taught us is we need to focus on speed and how to make learning efficient and effective.Because of these changes, investment is flowing into the edtech market at an unprecedented level. Entrepreneurs and established edtech companies are recognizing the opportunity to leverage innovative products across market boundaries and are designing tools for the “adult” market, instead of education versus corporate.The key trends for 2017 reflect how the training industry continues to evolve. And the trends we see are not those which are flash in the pan, short term, hot applications – but rather, changes to the market that will have a lasting impact for years to come.Fueled by the learner’s ability and need to consume content fast, when and how they want it, investment in educational technologies is translating into a level of innovation we’ve never seen in corporate training. Tools for content development and delivery, digital readers, virtual delivery, reinforcement, content libraries, gaming and cloud-based administration systems, all are bringing a level of innovation that is at an all-time high for corporate training. Much of the investment is coming from companies that have traditionally invested in public and post-secondary education but are now shifting their focus to the corporate market. The main reason for this shift is best practices for developing and consuming knowledge-based content transcends age levels, as well as market boundaries for adult education and corporate training.With the influx of mobile devices and the demand for short, object-based content increasing, learning libraries have grown rapidly. This rapid growth means that learners have access to virtually any type of learning content they want any time they want it; on virtually any device they choose. Having this abundance of information available can be a positive thing for learners, but training professionals must have a strategy in place to ensure learners are consuming the content designed specifically for their job requirements. The good news is training professionals can more easily meet the needs of learners through learning libraries for roles with competencies that are more market generic. The training leaders challenge is to better manage the content that is proprietary to the corporation to fill the gaps from ubiquitous learning libraries.Training professionals have the unique responsibility of supporting the needs of the business while understanding the needs of the learner, and bringing both together to improve performance. This responsibility is similar to that of marketing. Marketing must understand customer and client needs, while marketing products and services that meet those needs. Adopting a marketing-based approach to understand the needs of learners by using analytics and demand-generation strategies allows the training organization to target competency-based content directly to those who need it. Training organizations can then develop, promote and implement learning initiatives based on a profound understanding of learners’ needs and can help training organizations brand themselves and engage their learners more effectively. This is not about marketing the availability of courseware for the purpose of increasing the consumption of content. It is about using analytical data and intelligence about the learner’s needs to better target content directly to the learner who needs it.Identifying ways to improve the learning experience while minimizing the impact on employee downtime have been challenges across the industry. Adaptive learning is about personalizing the learning experience. By using adaptive learning techniques, we can reduce the time it takes learners to become proficient, eliminating the need to cover content they already understand. This improves the effectiveness of our programs because the learner only focuses on what is absolutely needed. Traditional approaches to content design involved developing courseware in a one-size-fits-all approach and then expecting the learner to consume the content. Adaptive learning is about adapting the content to the learner’s needs. For many years, the training function has been interested in personalizing the experience, but now they can accomplish this objective by letting the platform adjust information based on a learner’s previous responses. The future success of adaptive learning is not only in the design of the technology, but in the design of content. Content must be shortened and modified into learning objects, so it can be consumed based only on what the learner needs.Research related to the science of learning has taught us that one of the most effective techniques for increasing retention and application is to reinforce content over an extended period. Extending the learning experience pre- and post-training requires multiple touches throughout the learning experience. Technology is changing the way content is accessed and consumed, and changing how training leaders look to design learning experiences. In a 2016 study, 79 percent of training leaders told us that offering alternatives for training modalities is vital to their success. From mobile apps and e-learning, to job aids and simulations, employees need multiple touches and ways to consume information and drive behavior change. Essentially, these multiple touches transform training from an event into an extended learning experience.As the outsourcing market for large scale, comprehensive BPO deals are declining, we are seeing more growth in project, mission or initiative-based training engagements. We refer to these as “burst” engagements. A training “burst” is where the supplier is contracted to manage any or all processes associated with a defined training initiative – such as a product launch, technology implementation or change management initiative. When the initiative is completed, the supplier engagement ends. The primary difference of this from traditional BPO engagements is those are “process” oriented. Burst engagements are project based, and the terms of the contract are more directed at the deliverables related to completing the initiative. Burst engagements provide an innovative option to the training leader and substantially reduces the risks of traditional process outsourcing engagements.Game-based learning enhances motivation, engagement and knowledge retention. Early implementation of gaming focused on replacing the classroom experience with a game. The next evolutionary step in gaming saw us learning how to embed gaming programs within the learning program. We are now learning that at the heart of every engaging game (e.g., video games) lies an enticing story that pulls players in, appealing to their motivations and emotions. The evolution of gaming theory has found that using the principle of storytelling and engagement is key to appealing to learner emotions while enhancing learner engagement and recall.As virtual delivery platforms and online training programs have increased in popularity and adoption, average class enrollments continue to reduce in size. In the days of traditional classrooms, the objective was often to increase class sizes to amortize the fixed costs associated with an instructor and classroom across multiple students. There was always a conflict with the notion that smaller class sizes were better for students; while larger class sizes were more efficient for the business. Now the business’ needs and learners’ needs are aligned with the idea that training is becoming more affordable to deliver in smaller groups.Driven by a performing economy, buy-side companies are hiring more internal staff for training than in previous years. This is driving up their mix of internal to external spend. Just a few years ago, the average spend for buy-side companies was around 58 percent for internal resources and 42 percent for external. Our most recent study showed that over the last two years companies have moved the balance to more of a 60/40 or an expected 61/39 split in 2016. So while the overall corporate training market is still growing, we are seeing a relatively flat spend occurring with suppliers, especially with large scale BPO engagements. This trend may be short lived depending on the future global economy. Our experience has shown that as the economy improves, companies tend to hire more staff for training. As the economy declines, companies tend to move full-time resources to variable resources.","If the world is experiencing a technology revolution, then many of our schools are at the forefront of change. Educational technology is no longer relegated to computer labs or media rooms. Instead, laptops, tablets, Smartboards, and even cellphones are incorporated into everyday learning tasks.","Personalized learning has become one of the most talked-about strategies in education today. Public, private and charter schools across the country are experimenting with new approaches to personalized learning and figuring out how best to tailor instruction to the needs and desires of individual students.Using insights from prior reporting and interviews with practitioners and researchers in the field, we have compiled a list of top trends in the personalized learning space. In no particular order of importance, you’ll find this list below.As a bonus, we also included three things that are on the horizon in personalized learning. Educators and ed tech providers alike should have these things on their radar as they are sure to take a more central role in personalized learning in the years to come.  These learning management systems aim to unify online curriculum and content with instructional and administrative work. They are designed to make personalizing instruction simple for teachers. There are a number of PLPs on the market and some school systems have done the work of building their own to better meet local needs.Schools are also finding ways to let more natural light into classrooms and teachers are organizing their rooms into stations so students can cycle through areas for small-group instruction, solo online work and one-on-one time with teachers. All of this contributes to respecting students as individuals and supporting them as they move at their own pace.Traditional instruction has been marked by a teacher lecturing students who passively receive the content. In the personalized learning world, schools are turning that teacher role on its head, transitioning educators from being the providers of all knowledge to the facilitators of learning.This is a more complicated role for teachers, who have to learn new classroom management strategies and relinquish control of instruction. It also takes more work from students, who have to be engaged participants in every lesson. In many schools, the transition to personalized learning is a complicated one for all involved.With personalized learning comes a focus on helping each student progress through a given curriculum at his or her own pace. At its best, personalized learning can shift the measure of academic progress from time spent in a classroom to competencies mastered.Teachers have found project-based learning to be an important element of personalized learning approaches. With well-designed projects, students can get the freedom to explore topics they find most interesting. Personalized learning is not simply progress at a student’s individual pace, but also content tailored to a student’s personal interests.Just like ramps help make building entrances accessible for people in wheelchairs, parents pushing strollers, and others, UDL can make curriculum accessible for students with different learning styles, needs and preferences. The benefits of this approach are important even beyond inclusion for students with diagnosed learning disabilities. UDL benefits everyone in a classroom.Some schools formalize personalized learning by creating individual plans for every student. These plans are created collaboratively by students, parents and teachers as well as other support personnel, and they are updated throughout the year as living documents that grow and change as students do.Personalized learning plans outline student goals spanning personal, academic and career realms. They help structure academic content so student learning can be directly tied to achieving those goals. Often, schools develop these plans through student-led conferences, putting students as young as elementary school in the driver’s seat of their own educations.Personalized learning has seen a renaissance because of new educational technologies that make it easier for teachers to assess student progress on a day-to-day basis and differentiate instruction based on that data. Still, the space is changing all the time.One way personalized learning could become more effective is through data-sharing. Analytics-based assessments of what online modules are most effective for what types of students can help teachers and schools structure their own curricula to use the best materials. Open educational resources and marketplaces for teacher-created content are blossoming — but without data-based assessments of what works, progress will be tempered.School and district administrators continue to complain that the technology systems available to support personalized learning are limited. There are strong learning management systems that can’t be integrated with student information systems and parent communication systems or online learning systems. In the years to come, ed tech companies will work to improve this interoperability or create all-in-one systems.At the higher-education level, competency-based education has already led to a raft of alternative credentialing options that let students display their academic progress down to individual skill attainment. At the K-12 level, this type of system could help motivate students as they work toward their own diplomas and give them ready-made examples of accomplishments to highlight on college transcripts.","","“Using data to point to what’s actually happening in a district encourages collaboration across departments to make sure that teachers are in the classroom as much possible, and that when they are engaged in professional development, it is for meaningful and substantial learning that makes their time away from the classroom worthwhile.”","Schools now recognize the influence wireless and mobile technologies are having on their students as well as how it's shaping new ways of thinking and teaching. More colleges and universities are starting to get on board with utilizing newer learning methods for higher education that are targeted to how students want to learn and what are most effective for them to succeed not only in the classroom but after they graduate.Flipped Learning is a form of blended learning where students learn their lessons at home by watching video lectures and studying content online, and then doing their homework in class. Basically instead of learning directly from the teacher students learn from each other through a process of small groups using critical problem solving.By using Wi-Fi enabled classroom technology and various mobile-app solutions you can create the interactive environment that students benefit the most from. The value for educators comes from generating powerful analytics to measure student responses while also having the ability to stay engaged with your students in and out of the classroom.This model allows students who can't make it to school still attend virtually. They attend class through video and access content online. Other technologies can also be used including video conferencing, class forums, pre-recorded videos, social media, and email. In the same way you can bring in students remotely, you can also bring in teachers or subject matter experts. This provides a higher quality of learning that would otherwise be unavailable due to distance or time. Education becomes tailored to the needs of the student, making it accessible to everyone. The challenges of time and distance become inconsequential when all you need is a reliable wifi network paired with the right mobile technologies.Gamification is the concept of applying game-design thinking to different classroom tasks to make them more fun and engaging. The idea is to use the typical game system of providing challenges, rewarding winners, then providing harder challenges with equally bigger rewards.When you win at a game, your mind releases dopamine, a chemical in the brain that triggers motivation and pleasure. This makes learning a positive experience, one that you won’t have to force students to enjoy. So the main concept is to challenge the students, let them feel good about overcoming the challenge, then challenge them more. Mind maps make learning interactive and multi-dimensional instead of unidirectional and passive. It’s graphic and visual, using circled ideas that are linked together with lines, the same way the human mind works. This makes it easier for students to understand and recall information. You might think it would cost more to provide tablets for every student in your school but think of how many textbooks you are saving every year. Textbooks are getting more expensive and they are usually used for seven years before a new edition comes out. Social media is usually considered a huge distraction when it comes to the classroom. From Facebook to YouTube and Twitter many educators are fearful of its use, but this is a short-sided view. With the right strategy in place and the right wireless infrastructure social media can be a very useful and powerful tool for both students and teachers.There are numerous ways to use social media for learning. An online group can bring students together to work on projects and assignments together and hashtags for Twitter can be used to organize interactive conversations based on a specific subject or problem.Writing continues to be the focal point of Pamela’s professional life and molds her personality.
