["Many people think that cancer is caused by DNA damage and that not even nature can cure cancer. Both of these assumptions are pure nonsense. Most likely everything you know about cancer was intentionally designed to deceive you so that cancer patients will choose the wrong cancer treatments.Cancer is not caused by DNA damage. The definition of a cancer cell is a cell with low ATP energy (i.e. a low level of adenosine triphosphate). It is difficult to imagine a cell biologist who is so stupid they think that DNA damage can cause low levels of ATP energy. Only a very, very small fraction of DNA has anything to do with the creation of ATP energy.Killing cancer cells is “old school” but there is nothing wrong with things that can safely target and kill cancer cells (such as purple grape juice), but the new approach is to kill the microbes inside the cancer cells. This was first done in the 1930s but that technology was persecuted and shut down by the FDA and AMA. It has been restored, however, by the High RF Frequency Devices (which are not their real name, which we cannot use on this website due to the FDA).You probably think that orthodox medicine (e.g. the pharmaceutical industry, oncologists, the American Medical Association or AMA, etc.) has a 5-year cure rate for cancer patients of more than 50 percent. A “5-year cure rate” would mean, by definition, that 50 percent or more of their cancer patients are still alive five years after being diagnosed with cancer.Choosing a cancer treatment is literally a life-and-death decision. The “cure rates” for different cancer treatments can range from 3 to 95 percent for the same type of cancer. So who is telling the truth and who is lying? And if they are lying, why are they lying?“A 2004 study in the journal Clinical Oncology evaluated the contribution of chemotherapy to 5-year survival rates among adult cancer patients. In other words, the goal of the study was to look at how significant chemotherapy's role was in successful treatment outcomes (defined by oncologists as 5-year survival). In order to arrive at a meaningful conclusion, data from many previous studies was pooled and analyzed. The 22 most common cancer types were included in the study.“The results were surprising. The overall contribution of chemotherapy to five-year survival in American adults was 2.1 percent. This means that approximately 98 percent of the credit for survival was attributed to all other treatments, such as surgery, radiation, nutrition, etc.“In reality, the average five-year survival rate for cancer is 69 percent. This includes all stages of cancer and makes no distinction between who received which treatments. However, given the most commonly used treatments in oncology today, it is safe to assume that many of these surviving patients received chemotherapy.“At this point, it is important to discuss what 5-year survival means. In the oncology world, 5-year survival measures the percentage of patients who are still alive five years from the date of diagnosis. It does not mean that they are cancer-free, and it does not mean that they are completely healthy. Instead, it simply means that they have not died from cancer (or any other cause) in the five years since diagnosis.“Survival rates can be further broken down. For example, cancer-specific survival looks at the percentage of patients with a particular type of cancer and can be further broken down to look at survival rates for each stage of cancer. Using the 5-year survival statistic with respect to breast cancer, we see that Stage 0 or Stage I breast cancer has a 5-year survival rate of nearly 100 percent.“Stage IV breast cancer has a 5-year survival rate of approximately 22 percent. Thus, when we look at survival rates for cancer, it is important to be as specific as possible with regard to cancer type and cancer stage since some cancers have very poor survival rates while others have very good ones.“I always tell my patients that it is important to look at survival statistics on the population level in order to know what we are dealing with, but it is equally important to realize that those statistics do not necessarily apply to them. Many factors contribute to treatment outcomes, and many of those are directly in the patient’s control.”As if the battle against cancer weren't bad enough, some chemical companies seem dedicated to making you sick so that you will need prescription drugs. For example, Monsanto loves to put chemicals in your foods and loves for you to eat GMO foods. Because the average person has been brainwashed by the media, they  think that nature can do nothing to help cancer.Why did he go to jail? Because he used products to treat cancer which cannot be patented. Thus, the pharmaceutical industry and medical community had no interest in his treatments because they cannot make huge profits from treatments that cannot be patented.In other words, Dr. Kelly was not a medical doctor and he used natural medicine to achieve his 93 percent cure rate. Using Nature is an unforgivable sin according to the AMA and the media. His cure rate was irrelevant. Dr. Kelley died on January 30, 2005, at the age of 79.But who would make huge profits telling cancer patients to drink a quart of carrot juice, mixed with a little beet juice, every day, and eat a healthy diet? Certainly not the medical community and certainly not the pharmaceutical industry and media. Carrot juice and beet juice cannot be patented. Nor can a healthy diet be patented.The general public is so brainwashed they think Nature is too stupid to be a medical doctor. Yet scientists only understand about 3 percent of human DNA after studying it since 1953. This means scientists still don't have a clue what 97 percent of all human DNA does.Dr. Royal Rife, a microbiologist, had a 100 percent cure rate using electromedicine to kill microbes inside the cancer cells. The American Medical Association (AMA) tried to buy him out. Rife refused so the FDA shut him down and destroyed his lab and inventory.And there are many others. In fact, the best cancer researchers ever are all alive today. We have had to develop very advanced cancer protocols because many of the patients we work with are very sick due to their starting their cancer treatment with orthodox cancer treatments.But it was a natural medicine cancer researcher (who obviously did not win a Nobel Prize) who discovered that the low ATP energy was caused by microbes inside the cancer cells which intercept glucose before it can be converted into pyruvate and then, via two chemical cycles, into ATP.By killing these microbes, cancer cells can be reverted into normal cells. We now know it is not even necessary to kill cancer cells, they can be reverted into normal cells. The ICRF (Independent Cancer Research Foundation, Inc. – natural medicine researchers) has developed more than 25 treatments that revert cancer cells into normal cells.There are many cures for cancer. But these cures do not come from the pharmaceutical industry. The multi-billionaires/trillionaires who own the pharmaceutical industry have zero interest in the “little people” surviving their cancer.The politicians, of course, side with the trillionaires because they are the ones who own the media and thus they are the ones who own the minds of the American people. You cannot get elected to the White House without selling out to the super-rich.Cures for cancer must come from cancer researchers who have integrity and do not work for the pharmaceutical industry or Food and Drug Administration (Congress has given the FDA to the pharmaceutical industry as a gift to crush anyone who can cure a highly profitable disease) or any of the large cancer charities (which are controlled by the pharmaceutical industry).The American Cancer Society and Susan G. Komen For The Cure have no interest in curing cancer. They are collecting money. In fact, the American Cancer Society was really founded by John D. Rockefeller Jr. — son of the founder of the pharmaceutical industry.No wonder the ACS has never found a cure for cancer. They have never been looking for a cure for cancer and they never will. If the ACS hired one of the ICRF researchers they would have over 25 cures for cancer within one week. But that will never happen.By using the constant repetition of seeing “medical doctors” on television, people are conditioned (the “uniform pattern of public utterance”) to believe that anyone who is not a “medical doctor” must be a quack (the “jarring dissonance”).This process has been going on for many years, long before you were born or television was invented. The Big Cartel of the media, the pharmaceutical industry, the politicians, the medical industry, etc. don't want people to know that cancer can be cured.Because there are many cures for cancer in Nature, the super rich, who own the pharmaceutical industry and the media, make sure that no human being in America or in any other country, knows or believes that there are, in fact, scores of ways to cure cancer using natural medicine, meaning medicine from Nature.Safely targeting cancer cells and killing cancer cells, or safely reverting cancer cells into normal cells, is not even remotely on the agenda of Big Pharma or Big Medicine or Big Media or Big Corrupt Politicians or Big Charities. But suppressing these cures is one of their highest priorities.For example, Dr. Royal Rife, a microbiologist, had a 100 percent cure rate on cancer by reverting cancer cells into normal cells. He did this in the 1930s by using gentle electrical currents (which is one form of “electromedicine”) to kill the microbes which are inside the cancer cells.The American Medical Association (AMA) tried to “buy out Rife” so they could destroy his machines. Rife refused their “offer” so the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) shut him down and destroyed all of his lab and his machines that had not already been sold.You probably didn't know about Dr. Rife because the media has never told you about his 100 percent cure rate. The media has also not told you that his device has been replicated using modern technology and that you can buy these devices over the Internet.So why hasn't the media told you about Dr. Rife and Dr. Kelley and many others? Why haven't all of the media's high-powered “investigative journalists” told their viewers about Dr. Kelley? Do these “journalists” not know how to read or search the Internet? What are they looking for — lost cats? Maybe someone should tell them about Google.Did it ever occur to anyone that the “investigative journalists” are not allowed to investigate the media because they work for the media? If the media is part of a cover-up, how are people going to find out? And who is going to believe there is a cover-up?Why hasn't the American Medical Association forced their members to use Dr. Kelley's cancer treatments? The AMA certainly knows about Dr. Kelly's treatments because they, along with the Food and Drug Administration, had Kelley thrown in jail because he was curing cancer, cutting into their profits and making them look bad.In fact, there are only two cancer research organizations on this planet which teach about and research Dr. Rife's and Dr. Kelley's protocols: the Independent Cancer Research Foundation (which runs this website) and the American Anti-Cancer Institute in Washington state.Obviously, both of these cancer research organizations are very, very small because the media never talks about them because they refuse to jump in bed with the pharmaceutical industry. Contributions to these cancer research organizations are measured in hundreds of dollars a month, not millions of dollars a month.The reason is that everyone is looking for the most profitable cancer treatments, not the most effective cancer treatments. And the pharmaceutical industry has the most profitable cancer treatments. And everyone wants to be fed by Big Pharma.Those who have sold out to the pharmaceutical industry include the media (which may largely be owned by the owners of the pharmaceutical industry), the movie companies, Congress, the White House, the American Cancer Society, the Susan G. Komen Foundation, the state medical boards, the American Medical Association, the health insurance companies, etc. etc. etc.The health insurance companies are not allowed by the state insurance departments to write health insurance policies that pay the same percent for natural medicine cancer treatments as they allow to pay for orthodox cancer treatments. That is how deep the corruption and stupidity goes in the U.S.Well, there is more to it than that. Both the media, the pharmaceutical industry, the major banks, etc. are owned by multi-billionaires (and in at least one case – multi-trillionaires) who are all buddy-buddy with each other. They all know each other. They even have their own very exclusive clubs (e.g. the Bilderbergers). They are totally loyal to each other, which is precisely why the media is loyal to Big Pharma but not the common people.Now let's dig deeper into the tactics of the media to understand why the media is so successful at controlling the minds of the general public to the point that the general public won't believe the truth even when they hear it. Their tactics are highly sophisticated.The media controls the minds of the American people by showing “medical doctors” on television every chance they get, as already mentioned. Whether you are watching a movie, a drama, a sitcom, a news program, a comedy or whatever, there will likely be a medical doctor on the show at one time or another. Think about the Star Trek movies, for example. Was there a medical doctor in those movies? Yes.Furthermore, the general public thinks that Dr. Kelley, who had the 93 percent cure rate, was a quack because he did not use pharmaceutical industry drugs and he was not a medical doctor. It doesn't take a medical degree to tell cancer patients to take purple grape juice, a quart of carrot juice (with a little beet juice mixed in) or some other equally effective natural cancer treatment.Christ described this level of brainwashing in Matt. 23:27 in two words: “whited sepulcher.” The media paints the whitewash on the sepulcher (the general public only sees the whitewash) and thus the general public has no idea what is inside the sepulcher or that the sepulcher even exists. They can't see the bodies behind the television screen.Running to their medical doctor in many cases is the right thing to do. But in other cases (i.e. in the case of nearly all diseases), it is the wrong thing to do. Your doctor has no clue how to cure cancer, AIDS, Alzheimers, Multiple Sclerosis, ALS, and many other diseases. But there are people who do know how to deal with all of these diseases using natural medicine.The American Medical Association (AMA) is really nothing but a labor union. The AMA jumped in bed with the new pharmaceutical industry in 1907 and agreed to use the treatments that were most profitable for them, without any regard to the survival of their patients.This may sound harsh, but the evidence is overwhelming that that is exactly what happened. The AMA had been corrupt long before 1907 and John D. Rockefeller, Sr., who started the drug companies to make more money from his oil, was already known to be a ruthless businessman who had a fantastic public relations department which existed to make him look like a respectable citizen.The Foundation for the Advancement of Cancer Therapy is pointing to a quarter century of research that brings into question the decision cancer patients often make to undergo conventional treatments, including radiation [1] and chemotherapy, in hopes of prolonging life.But, FACT points to work by credible cancer researchers that seem to fly in the face of this commonly held belief. The late Dr. Hardin B. Jones, professor of medical physics and physiology at Berkeley, Calif., conducted research spanning 25 years in the life of cancer patients that led him to conclude that untreated cancer patients [2] did not die sooner.Professor Jones first presented his shocking research results at the American Cancer Society's Science Writers' Seminar in 1969. His findings confirmed an earlier paper he wrote in 1955 that shed doubt that common forms of treatment truly extended patient life.In his earlier paper, Dr. Jones illustrated how cancer study results were skewed to conclude that treated patients fared better. For example, patients who died while receiving treatment were not included in results, giving an unrealistically rosier picture of the survival rate of treated patients.In his 1969 presentation, the professor pointed out that research continued to shift results in favor of treatment. For example, patients whose cancer was extremely advanced were routinely placed in the group not receiving treatment. This left more patients who were less seriously impacted in the treated group, resulting in a higher survival rate for that group.Dr. Jones was able to determine that survival among breast cancer [4] sufferers were four times longer when conventional treatment was refused. Such patients typically lived an average of 12 1/2 years, compared with those undergoing treatment who lived only three years on average, leading the cancer researcher to conclude that without a doubt, radical surgery did more harm to cancer patients than it did good.Meanwhile, FACT points out, there has been no published work refuting the evidence presented by Dr. Jones. On the contrary, his conclusions have been supported by the work of other recognized researchers. Among them was Massachusetts Institute of Technology biologist Dr. Maurice Fox who published his paper in 1979 stating that radical mastectomy did not bring about better survival rates than simple lump removal.He also wrote that patients opting out of medical procedures actually had a lower mortality rate than those who chose to undergo treatment. Further, patients who received early diagnoses died even sooner, likely due to duration and intensity of treatment.Even those advocating conventional treatment as the best choice for cancer patients cannot dismiss the toll such procedures take on the body. Cancer patients opting to undergo such treatment plans must cope with greater pain and suffering, often to the point where it greatly impacts the quality of life.Patients undergoing conventional treatment can expect to cope with an often horrific list of serious side effects, including cancer growth and death. For example, as a known cancer-causing agent, radiation can actually spread cancer and lead to deadly metastases. Left untreated, however, the original cancerous tumor can often slow cancer's spread.Other common conditions that develop as a result of treatment include hemorrhage, tissue death, compromised immunity, liver failure [5], kidney dysfunction, blistering, prolonged vomiting, disorientation, anorexia, enteritis, and bone marrow depression, among other serious ills.Bringing these researchers' conclusions to light leaves cancer patients with a more difficult decision-making process, but one that may offer renewed choices. As always, patients ought to consult with a trusted medical doctor and loved ones in formulating the decision of whether or not to undergo treatments like radiation or chemotherapy.As with many decisions they face, cancer patients will need to review all information available to determine the best course of action. Choosing a path that includes conventional treatment should be done based on available scientifically-grounded evidence and personal preference, not out of pressure or fear that avoiding treatment will surely condemn the patient to a shorter life expectancy.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and American Medical Association (AMA) have jointly or individually “legally” shut down many clinics of cancer researchers who knew how to cure cancer. They have also shut down vendors of products which were highly effective against cancer. They also scare other vendors who pretty-much have to go into hiding.What if the FDA opened a cancer treatment center that used all of the natural cancer treatments they have shut down and some that are common knowledge which they did not shut down? What would the cure rate of this clinic be for newly diagnosed cancer patients?Both the FDA and AMA KNOW how to cure cancer. They just choose not to cure cancer and they choose to sit by and do nothing (except persecute or murder people who know how to cure cancer) while hundreds of thousands of Americans die every year because they trusted the medical associations, pharmaceutical industry, media, Congress, corrupt charities, ad nauseum.Cancer Tutor is here for you.

That is the concept. Get this cancer under control. It has gotten out of control in your body, temporarily. And, it is not that difficult as it turns out.Ninety percent of the time, it is some kind of swelling in an organ somewhere. The other ten percent, it is not a tumor, it is melanoma on the skin or it is lymphoma, leukemia. It is all the same thing in my experience, and I think you agree, cancer is cancer. It is all the same thing. It is an imbalance in our bodies where the immune system has been overwhelmed temporarily. We can restore that almost entirely with almost any kind of cancer. But, we have to be aware of what this is in order to deal with it.What is it? Well, I will tell you what I believe, and see if you agree. I think cancer is simply a symptom of an imbalance. It is sort of like diabetes, fibromyalgia, arthritis. It is a chronic, degenerative condition in our body caused by an imbalance.That imbalance, once you understand that that is what it is, you realize that this is not random, something randomly that happened to you. It has happened for a reason. Something has gone wrong in your body that has caused this cancer tumor to appear, or in whatever other form. Once you correct that reason, the cause of the imbalance, it goes away. The body is very capable of shrinking cancer tumors.Louis, I can only assume that you are referring to some practitioners in the USA though I am sure not all.  I can assure you that this is not the case with all natural health practitioners in other countries (of which I was one until retirement)  and one of my goals as a practitioner was to help people learn to heal themselves.  It is rather dismissive, insulting and somewhat ambiguous to imply that we don’t use methods that work through either lack of knowledge or fear of losing clients.  I don’t know anything about you other than that you appear to sell a brand of supplements.  Given that the aim of The Truth About Cancer is to encourage people to seek help and knowledge to help themselves you should refrain from making such statements about natural health practitioners and instead encourage people to seek out practitioners to assist them in their journey back to health.Laura:  K2 and D3 are vitamins that you can purchase in any health food store in the country.

Quite the opposite. The more scientists get to know each type of cancer inside and out, the greater the chance of finding new ways to tackle these diseases so that more people can survive.It has long been known that people in the UK have a lower chance of surviving breast, lung, bowel and ovarian cancer than people in some other developed countries, but the question still remains – why? There are quite a few possibilities. Do we diagnose and treat people with cancer…This post is about research published in April 2010.

Please I need an answer as soon as possibleMen aged 50 and over without potential prostate cancer symptoms can request a PSA test from their doctor, but it’s important these men have a conversation with their doctor first to understand the possible outcomes of having the test, so they can make an informed decision. I have had breast cancer first in 2006 and then again in 2015 with no particular history of breast cancer in my family.  My second cancer required a mastectomy and on histology it was discovered I had two difference types of cancer in the breast tissue.  I am on hormone treatment with Letrozole and Bisphosphonates.  Women are at least fortunate enough to have regular screening for breast cancer but unfortunately this is note the case for hormone related cancers in men :  why not? although it is said that PSA is not a reliable indicator at least it would be an indicator if it was 1307 !  Men who seek this test are often asked why they want it and are quite honestly not made to feel it is a right which it should be as I speak from first hand experience with my husband who only found out by accident with a referral to a consultant for a different matter.  This test should be rolled out for all men at 50 PLUSMy husband is now acutely ill with Pancreatic Cancer. He received the best and newest treatment available.

When they operated in July they found that the cancer had spread extensively despite his scan being clear. His disease has progressed so rapidly and he is now receiving end of life care. I can only hope and pray that a cure can be found for this horrendous disease.I think that with the amount of Charity money which is being raised for breast cancer that more could and should be done at least for that. 50 years on and we are still offering women the very devastating chemotherapy , surgery and radiotherapy trio.The drugs may be newer and better targeted but these are still tremendously harsh treatments.

However, when you look closely at the medical industry, the possibility of such a cover-up seems implausible.I have been living with cancer for three years and during that time been treated by approximately half a dozen medical practioners. I have been fortunate because almost all of them have been remarkably compassionate and caring people. At least one of them was motivated to pursue cancer research by the loss of a close relative.All of these individuals had partaken in medical research at some stage in their careers, and about half of them were actively involved in research regarding treating cancer patients at the time of my treatment. One of them sat on the board of a private pharmaceuticals company, another was an adviser to a government agency. If you look across the world there must be hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people like them. They are the people I am being asked to believe are conspiring to keep the truth hidden from me in order to keep their jobs. I believe that every single one of them would gladly quit their profession and retrain tomorrow if their patients could suddenly be cured without their help. Yet this conspiracy theory requires not just one or two bad-apples knowingly letting their patients die, but a huge number, probably the majority, of medical professionals, in medical research, would need to be involved.Of course it is! In Australia, where I live, the majority of research is funded by the government and done by universities and large teaching hospitals. The cost of treating cancer patients takes up a large, and increasing proportion of the government health budget. The cancer conspiracy would suggest that the government is so concerned about keeping the business running (in this case the hospital beds full) that they would hide any discovery that would free up hospital resources. Even the most cynical should realise that the huge cost of treating cancer patients is something the government is keen to reduce not increase. The financial incentive is clearly on the side of finding the cure, not hiding it.On the other hand, I would certainly concede that private commercial funding only targets treatments that would be profitable. Typically, this is patentable drugs and excludes most alternatives. So this type of research complements rather than replaces government funded research. But the fact that billions of dollars are being spent by private companies on such research is something that I am entirely grateful for. To me the idea that these companies could control medical knowledge, or even the individuals who work for them is ridiculous.Besides, the Internet is the home of conspiracy theories. You could find one on just about any subject. I am grateful we have so many independent thinkers and the freedom to express ourselves. But I get angry when I see vulnerable people being told lies and exploited for a profit.The tobacco industry makes billions of dollars from selling a major cancer causing product. Furthermore, the government makes additional billions from taxes on tobacco products. If there was ever a case where money was going to hide the facts about a product then this would be it.But has that happened? No. In Australia, cigarette boxes are covered with warnings like “Smoking Kills”and “Smoking is addictive” and advertising of tobacco products is totally banned. In fact the government spends millions of dollars educating the population about the dangers of smoking.There is evidence that initial research performed by tobacco companies was suppressed, so indeed these companies have certainly acted unethically and immorally. But despite the fact that  these businesses and the government make billions out of the industry, the truth was not suppressed for long. If anything, this case demonstrates that even when both big business and government have vast financial interests in hiding the truth, it simply can't be done.If history has taught us anything about cancer, it is that it is not an easy disease to cure. It is 2,400 years after the disease was first recorded by Hippocrates and presumably even longer since the first treatment was attempted. If traditional medicine has failed for this long, it seems to me that a cure will require every fraction of recently obtained knowledge about microbiology, the human genome, and modern medicine. It seems unlikely that fields of research outside this body of knowledge will make a lot of progress. But if an \"alternative\" practitioner did stumble onto an effective method, the scientific community would quickly embrace it and there would be no cover-up. I know there isn't any cancer conspiracy because I know that the people doing and running the research are human. Their lives, like mine, have been touched by cancer. They, like me, would do anything to save the lives of the people they love. Furthermore, I assume that any treatments associating themselves with  a conspiracy theory have something to hide—the simple fact that their treatment doesn't work.","","The technique the researchers used is fairly complex, but it all starts with iridium. Iridium is the second densest metal on the planet, and while it’s fairly rare to find here on Earth, it’s often found in large quantities in asteroids. The dinosaur-killing space rock that slammed into the earth some 65 million years ago is thought to have been responsible for much of the iridium found here today, and it’s a key ingredient in a cancer-fighting cocktail.To create the cancer-conquering substance, scientists created a compound of iridium and organic matter which was then used against the cancer cells. The compound converts the oxygen found within the cells into what is called singlet oxygen, which behaves dramatically when interacting with organic compounds and is toxic to the cancer. When the proteins of the targeted cancer are attacked it dies off, while the healthy cells around it remain unaffected.“This project is a leap forward in understanding how these new iridium-based anti-cancer compounds are attacking cancer cells, introducing different mechanisms of action, to get around the resistance issue and tackle cancer from a different angle,” Cookson Chiu, co-author of the study and postgraduate research at Warwick explained.","\n\t\t\tMy name is Kate mark, i want to tell the world about how i got cured from HIV Disease by Dr. Ozala. i was Infected with HIV Disease for so many years and i was tired of life because of the sufferings i was going through, so one faithful day a friend of mine gave me a contact of a herbal doctor who cured her cousin from HIV Disease and immediately i contacted the Doctor on his email address: (drozalahomeremedy@gmail.com) and his whatsapp: +2349074008745, and immediately the Doctor sent me a herbal medicine and told me to take the medicine only at bed time with is at night and i did and immediately the HIV Virus DISAPPEARED and i was cured from HIV Disease, the name of this Doctor is Dr Ozala.. so if you are infected with HIV Disease or any other dangerous and uncurable Disease then Dr. Ozala is the right man to be contacted for the cure. so kindly contact him now on his email: (drozalahomeremedy@gmail.com) or His Whatsapp number: +2349074008745... once again, Dr. Ozala thank you very much for what you did for me am very grateful...

For about 85% to 90% of children, the leukemia can, however, be effectively treated through chemotherapy.If it is not eliminated and comes back, it is, more often than not, fatal. Rounds of chemotherapy can buy patients time, but as the disease progresses, the periods of remission get shorter and shorter. “The options for these patients are not very good at all,” says Dr. Theodore Laetsch, a pediatrician at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.When Kaitlyn’s cancer wasn’t controlled after three years and round after round of chemotherapy drugs, her doctors had little else to offer. “They said, ‘This did nothing, it didn’t touch it,'” says Kaitlyn’s mother Mandy, a dental assistant from Royce City, Texas. “My stomach just dropped.” Kaitlyn could receive a bone-marrow transplant, but only about half of those procedures are successful, and there was a good chance that she would reject the donor cells. If that happened, her chances of surviving were very small.In a calculated gamble, her doctors suggested a radical new option: becoming a test subject in a trial of an experimental therapy that would, for the first time, use gene therapy to train a patient’s immune system to recognize and destroy their cancer in the same way it dispatches bacteria and viruses. The strategy is the latest development in immunotherapy, a revolutionary approach to cancer treatment that uses a series of precision strikes to disintegrate cancer from within the body itself. Joining the trial was risky, since other attempts to activate the immune system hadn’t really worked in the past. Mandy, her husband James and Kaitlyn traveled from their home in Texas to Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), where they stayed in a hotel for eight weeks while Kaitlyn received the therapy and recovered. “The thought crossed my mind that Kaitlyn might not come home again,” says Mandy. “I couldn’t tell you how many times I would be in the bathroom at the hospital, spending an hour in the shower just crying, thinking, What are we going to do if this doesn’t help her?”But it did. After receiving the therapy in 2015, the cancer cells in Kaitlyn’s body melted away. Test after test, including one that picks up one cancer cell in a million, still can’t detect any malignant cells lurking in Kaitlyn’s blood. What saved Kaitlyn was an infusion of her own immune cells that were genetically modified to destroy her leukemia. “You take someone who essentially has no possibility for a cure–almost every single one of these patients dies–and with [this] therapy, 90% go into remission,” says Dr. David Porter, director of blood and bone-marrow transplantation at the University of Pennsylvania. Such radical immune-based approaches were launched in 2011 with the success of intravenous drugs that loosen the brakes on the immune system so it can see cancer cells and destroy them with the same vigor with which they attack bacteria and viruses. Now, with the genetically engineered immune cells known as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells that were used in Kaitlyn’s study, doctors are crippling cancer in more precise and targeted ways than surgery, chemotherapy and radiation ever could. While the first cancer immunotherapies were broadly aimed at any cancer, experts are now repurposing the immune system into a personalized precision treatment that can not only recognize but also eliminate the cancer cells unique to each individual patient.What makes immune-based therapies like CAR T cell therapy so promising–and so powerful–is that they are a living drug churned out by the patients themselves. The treatment isn’t a pill or a liquid that has to be taken regularly, but a one-hit wonder that, when given a single time, trains the body to keep on treating, ideally for a lifetime.“This therapy is utterly transformative for this kind of leukemia and also lymphoma,” says Stephan Grupp, director of the cancer immunotherapy program at CHOP and one of the lead doctors treating patients in the study in which Kaitlyn participated.Eager to bring this groundbreaking option to more patients, including those with other types of cancers, an advisory panel for the Food and Drug Administration voted unanimously in July to move the therapy beyond the testing phase, during which several hundred people have been able to take advantage of it, to become a standard therapy for children with certain leukemias if all other treatments have failed. While the FDA isn’t obligated to follow the panel’s advice, it often does, and it is expected to announce its decision in a matter of weeks.Across the country, doctors are racing to enroll people with other cancers–breast, prostate, pancreatic, ovarian, sarcoma and brain, including the kind diagnosed in Senator John McCain–in hundreds of trials to see if they, too, will benefit from this novel approach. They are even cautiously allowing themselves to entertain the idea that this living drug may even lead to a cure for some of these patients. Curing cancers, rather than treating them, would result in a significant drop in the more than $120 billion currently spent each year on cancer care in the U.S., as well as untold suffering.This revolutionary therapy, however, almost didn’t happen. While the idea of using the body’s immune cells against cancer has been around for a long time, the practical reality had proved daunting. Unlike infection-causing bacteria and viruses that are distinctly foreign to the body, cancer cells start out as healthy cells that mutate and grow out of control, and the immune system is loath to target its own cells.“Only a handful of people were doing the research,” says Dr. Carl June, director of the Center for Cellular Immunotherapy at the University of Pennsylvania’s Abramson Cancer Center and the scientist who pioneered the therapy. A graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, June is all too familiar with the devastating effects of cancer, having lost his first wife to ovarian cancer and battled skin cancer himself. Trial after trial failed as reinfusions of immune cells turned out to be more of a hit-or-miss endeavor than a reliable road to remission.In the case of leukemias, that marker turned out to be CD19, a protein that all cancerous blood cells sprout on their surface. June repurposed immune cells to carry a protein that would stick to CD19, along with another marker that would activate the immune cells to start attacking the cancer more aggressively once they found their malignant marks. Using a design initially developed by researchers at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital for such a combination, June and his colleague Bruce Levine perfected a way to genetically modify and grow these cancer-fighting cells in abundance in the lab and to test them in animals with leukemia. The resulting immune platoon of CAR T cells is uniquely equipped to ferret out and destroy cancer cells. But getting them into patients is a complex process. Doctors first remove a patient’s immune cells from the blood, genetically tweak them in the lab to carry June’s cancer-targeting combination and then infuse the modified cells back into the patient using an IV.Because these repurposed immune cells continue to survive and divide, the therapy continues to work for months, years and, doctors hope, perhaps a lifetime. Similar to the way vaccines prompt the body to produce immune cells that can provide lifelong protection against viruses and bacteria, CAR T cell therapy could be a way to immunize against cancer. “The word vaccination would not be inappropriate,” says Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society.June’s therapy worked surprisingly well in mice, shrinking tumors and, in some cases, eliminating them altogether. He applied for a grant at the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health to study the therapy in people from 2010 to 2011. But the idea was still so new that many scientists believed that testing it in people was too risky. In 1999, a teenager died days after receiving an experimental dose of genes to correct an inherited disorder, and anything involving gene therapy was viewed suspiciously. While such deaths aren’t entirely unusual in experimental studies, there were ethical questions about whether the teenager and his family were adequately informed of the risks and concerns that the doctor in charge of the study had a financial conflict of interest in seeing the therapy develop. Officials in charge of the program acknowledged that important questions were raised by the trial and said they took the questions and concerns very seriously. But the entire gene-therapy program was shut down. All of that occurred at the University of Pennsylvania–where June was. His grant application was rejected.It would take two more years before private funders–the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society and an alumnus of the university who was eager to support new cancer treatments–donated $5 million to give June the chance to bring his therapy to the first human patients.It was also the day he went to the hospital to become the first person ever to receive the combination gene and CAR T cell therapy, in 2010. For Ludwig, the experimental therapy was his only remaining option. Like many people with leukemia, Ludwig had been living on borrowed time for a decade, counting the days between the chemotherapy treatments that would hold the cancer in his blood cells at bay for a time. Inevitably, like weeds in an untended garden, the leukemia cells would grow and take over his blood system again.But the periods of reprieve were getting dangerously short. “I was running out of treatments,” says Ludwig. So when his doctor mentioned the trial conducted by June and Porter at the University of Pennsylvania, he didn’t hesitate. “I never thought that the clinical trial was going to cure me,” he says. “I just wanted to live and to continue to fight. If there was something that would put me into the next month, still breathing, then that’s what I was looking for.”When Ludwig signed the consent form for the treatment, he wasn’t even told what to expect in terms of side effects or adverse reactions. The scientists had no way of predicting what would happen. “They explained that I was the first and that they obviously had no case law, so to speak,” he says. So when he was hit with a severe fever, had difficulty breathing, showed signs of kidney failure and was admitted to the intensive care unit, he assumed that the treatment wasn’t working.His condition deteriorated so quickly and so intensely that doctors told him to call his family to his bedside, just four days after he received the modified cells. “I told my family I loved them and that I knew why they were there,” he says. “I had already gone and had a cemetery plot, and already paid for my funeral.”Rather than signaling the end, Ludwig’s severe illness turned out to be evidence that the immune cells he received were furiously at work, eliminating and sweeping away the huge burden of cancer cells choking up his bloodstream. But his doctors did not realize it at the time.It wasn’t until the second patient, Doug Olson, who received his CAR T cells about six weeks after Ludwig, that Porter had a eureka moment. When he received the call that Olson was also running a high fever, having trouble breathing and showing abnormal lab results, Porter realized that these were signs that the treatment was working. “It happens when you kill huge amounts of cancer cells all at the same time,” Porter says. What threw him off initially is that it’s rare for anything to wipe out that much cancer in people with Ludwig’s and Olson’s disease. June and Porter have since calculated that the T cells obliterated anywhere from 2.5 lb. to 7 lb. of cancer in Ludwig’s and Olson’s bodies. “I couldn’t fathom that this is why they both were so sick,” says Porter. “But I realized this is the cells: they were working, and working rapidly. It was not something we see with chemotherapy or anything else we have to treat this cancer.”Ludwig has now been in remission for seven years, and his success led to the larger study of CAR T cell therapy in children like Kaitlyn, who no longer respond to existing treatments for their cancer. The only side effect Ludwig has is a weakened immune system; because the treatment wipes out a category of his immune cells–the ones that turned cancerous–he returns to the University of Pennsylvania every seven weeks for an infusion of immunoglobulins to protect him from pneumonia and colds. Olson, too, is still cancer-free.While the number of people who have received CAR T cell therapy is still small, the majority are in remission. That’s especially encouraging for children, whose lives are permanently disrupted by the repeated cycles of treatments that currently are their only option. “It’s a chance for these kids to have a normal life and a normal childhood that doesn’t involve constant infusions, transfusions, infections and being away from their home, family and school,” says Dr. Gwen Nichols, chief medical officer of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.The hope is that while CAR T cell therapy will at first be reserved for people who have failed to respond to all standard treatments, eventually they won’t have to wait that long. As doctors learn from pioneers like Kaitlyn, Ludwig and Olson, they will have more confidence in pushing the therapy earlier, when patients are stronger and the cancer is less advanced–perhaps as a replacement for or in combination with other treatments.The severe immune reaction triggered by the therapy remains a big concern. While it can be monitored in the hospital and managed with steroids or antibodies that fight inflammation, there have been deaths in other trials involving CAR T cells. One drug company put one of its studies on hold due to the toxic side effects. “I am excited by CAR T therapy, but I’m also worried that some people might get too excited,” says the American Cancer Society’s Brawley. “It’s important that we proceed slowly and do this meticulously so that we develop this in the right way.”For now, CAR T cells are expensive–some analysts estimate that each patient’s batch of cells would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars–because they require a bespoke production process. If approved, Novartis, which licensed the technology from the University of Pennsylvania, will provide the therapy in about 35 cancer centers in the U.S. by the end of the year. Other companies are already working toward universal T cells that could be created for off-the-shelf use in any patient with cancer. “This is just the beginning,” says June.","But now he had checked himself in to Seattle Children’s Hospital. An aspiring model, he had taken a fall before a photo shoot and found he couldn’t shake off the pain in his ribs. When the doctors started preparing him for a spinal tap, he knew the cancer was back. “I said, Oh, man, they are going to tell me I relapsed again,” he recalls. “They’re going to give me my six months.”But Wright did. In 2013 his cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, was destroyed with a new type of treatment in which cells from his immune system, called T cells, were removed from his blood, genetically engineered to target his cancer, and then dripped back into his veins. Although Wright was only the second person at Seattle Children’s to receive the treatment, earlier results in Philadelphia and New York had been close to miraculous. In 90 percent of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia that has returned and resists regular drugs, the cancer goes away. The chance of achieving remission in these circumstances is usually less than 10 percent.Those results explain why a company called Juno Therapeutics raised $304 million when it went public in December, 16 months after its founding. In a coup of good timing, the venture capitalists and advisors who established Juno by licensing experimental T-cell treatments in development at Seattle Children’s, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and hospitals in New York and Memphis took the potential cancer cure public amid a historic bull market for biotech and for immunotherapy in particular. Its IPO was among the largest stock market offerings in the history of the biotechnology industry.The T-cell therapies are the most radical of several new approaches that recruit the immune system to attack cancers. An old idea that once looked like a dead end, immunotherapy has roared back with stunning results in the last four years. Newly marketed drugs called checkpoint inhibitors are curing a small percentage of skin and lung cancers, once hopeless cases. More than 60,000 people have been treated with these drugs, which are sold by Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb. The treatments work by removing molecular brakes that normally keep the body’s T cells from seeing cancer as an enemy, and they have helped demonstrate that the immune system is capable of destroying cancer. Juno’s technology for engineering the DNA of T cells to guide their activity is at an earlier, more experimental stage. At the time of its IPO, Juno offered data on just 61 patients with leukemia or lymphoma.Juno is located in South Lake Union, a Seattle neighborhood dominated by Amazon.com, whose CEO, Jeff Bezos, was an early investor in the company. During a day spent at Juno’s labs and offices in May, the phrase I heard repeated over and over was “proof of principle.” That’s what cases like Wright’s have provided. The studies are small, with no control groups, no comparisons, but also no other explanation than T cells for why the cancer disappears. “It’s proved that the T cell is the drug,” says Hans Bishop, a former Bayer executive who is the company’s CEO.Bishop argues that medicine is entering a new phase in which cells will become living drugs. It is a third pillar of medicine. The pharmaceuticals that arose from synthetic chemistry made up the first pillar. Then, after Genentech produced insulin in a bacterium in 1978, came the revolution of protein drugs. Now companies like Juno are hoping to use our own cells as the treatment. In the case of T cells, the tantalizing evidence is that some cancers could be treated with few side effects other than a powerful fever.Moving beyond the proof of principle won’t be easy. No one has ever manufactured a cellular treatment of any commercial consequence. It’s not certain what the best way to make and deliver such personalized treatments would be. Nor is it clear whether engineered T cells can treat a wide variety of cancers; this year Juno and others are launching new studies to find out. Even in leukemia, cancer that affects the bone marrow and blood, it’s too early to declare a cure. The majority of patients receiving the therapy have been treated only in the last 12 months. About 25 percent have seen their cancers roar back, sometimes mutated in a way that makes them immune to the T cells. At 18 months since his treatment, Wright, who hopes to become a police officer, is one of the longest survivors.Juno isn’t the only company chasing the T-cell idea. More than 30 companies have started clinical tests or are planning them, including Novartis, which says it may file for approval for a competing leukemia treatment in 2016. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last summer gave both Novartis and Juno so-called breakthrough designation, meaning that their leukemia treatments could be approved after only one larger clinical trial.If early results hold, tests of engineered T cells in blood cancers may lead to one of the fastest approvals in the history of drug development. It could take as little as seven years, whereas the average drug takes closer to 14 years. “That is unheard of in the industry,” says Usman Azam, head of gene and cell therapy for Novartis.At Juno I met the CFO, Steven Harr, who before joining the company was an investment banker specializing in biotech at Morgan Stanley. I asked whether he’d ever paid attention to cell therapy companies while on Wall Street. No, he said. Just the opposite. They were considered dogs, chasing an idea that didn’t work—and even if it did, it was too complicated to commercialize. The FDA lists 14 approved cell therapies, most of which are skin grafts or involve storing umbilical cords.But Harr says he “jumped on the bandwagon” when he saw the data from the leukemia patients. Now he thinks Juno will find an economic advantage by solving the difficult problem of how to commercialize cellular treatments. “It’s a living thing—it’s different from a pill,” he says.“They hyped it up, like it was going to be amazing,” Wright remembers. He’d signed up for the clinical trial right away, but he didn’t tell anyone he was at the hospital. His mom was texting him: “Where you at? What’s up?” After a few days he finally told her. “I’m at Children’s. I’m getting ready for a trial.” Wright underwent a two-hour process known as leukapheresis, in which his blood was passed through a device to separate out the T cells. The cells were taken to a lab, where a strand of new DNA was inserted using a virus. Two weeks later he got the treatment: a 10-minute drip from an IV bag to reinfuse the cells. Easy stuff compared with chemotherapy. And at first, nothing happened.A sign of how potent the T-cell treatments are is that most patients suffer from “cytokine release syndrome,” a storm of molecules generated as the cells fight the cancer. At least seven patients have been killed by the syndrome. Wright’s doctors kept checking in to see if he had developed a fever, which would signal that the T cells were working. “They were pressuring me—‘Come on, call us,’” he says. Two weeks later it came on like a body-flattening flu. He was admitted to the ICU and says he was barely lucid when smiling doctors told him they couldn’t find cancer in his body.Carl June, the University of Pennsylvania doctor who publicized some of the first successful treatments with engineered T cells, has likened what’s happening inside patients’ bodies to “serial killing” and “mass murder.” As the billions of T cells in a dose multiply, they can locate and kill several pounds of tumor.It’s an idea as dangerous as it is powerful. The reason is that few antigens appear exclusively in cancer cells. In 2009, a woman given T cells engineered to recognize colon cancer suddenly went into respiratory distress; she died five days later. Doctors at the National Cancer Institute quickly canceled the study, concluding that the T cells had encountered their antigen in her lungs and attacked.Scientists like Sadelain soon zeroed in on one ideal antigen, called CD19. It appears nowhere in the body except on B cells, the same kind that go awry in lymphoma and in the leukemia that afflicted Wright. And it turns out that wiping out a person’s B cells isn’t life-threatening. With shots of immunoglobulin, you can live without any for years.By 2010, doctors at Memorial Sloan Kettering, Penn, and the National Cancer Institute had begun trying to treat leukemia patients with T cells bearing a doctored receptor for CD19. To the inside of the receptor, they’d added another snippet of DNA that stimulates the cells to divide. No one is sure how the stimulation works, but without it, the modified T cells don’t do much. Early case reports eventually multiplied into trials that have treated about 350 leukemia and lymphoma patients. The results are remarkable, partly because they’re so consistent, even though each lab uses slightly different DNA designs.Penn’s first results were well publicized and drew the attention of Novartis, the world’s second-largest drug company. In August 2012, it agreed to give the university $20 million to build a new cell-therapy center as part of an alliance through which Penn’s T-cell therapies will be sponsored and owned by the Swiss pharmaceutical giant. The deal was notable for being struck on the basis of published data from just three patients, and now it looks like a bargain.It also makes Juno a “fast follower,” in startup parlance. Incorporated in August 2013, it is “a company of many fathers,” says Lawrence Corey, an infectious-disease doctor who was then the president of Fred Hutchinson. Corey, aided by the venture capitalist Bob Nelsen and Richard Klausner, the former director of the National Cancer Institute and now chief medical officer of the DNA-sequencing company Illumina, created Juno by buying up patents and licensing rights to T-cell trials under way in Seattle and at Sloan Kettering in New York.Since its IPO, Juno’s stock market value has surged above $6 billion, reflecting intense speculation that engineered T cells will prove to be a new way to treat many types of cancer, not only the relatively rare leukemia Wright suffered from. Juno’s executives believe that they can quickly come up with new T cell designs and obtain a “fast readout” by testing them in terminal cancer patients, where risks are easy to justify. The company plans to have 10 studies of six different T-cell designs in progress by next year. “We are looking for breakthroughs,” says Mark Frohlich, a doctor who is Juno’s vice president for strategy. “We aren’t going to say, ‘Okay, two months survival.’”The big question mark is whether T cells will work in cancers other than those of the blood. The week before I visited Juno, investors briefly sent its shares tumbling by 35 percent after Novartis and Penn reported that low doses of engineered T cells had no dramatic effects in five patients with cancers of the pancreas, ovaries, or lung. Still, the data were too preliminary to indicate much. “We know it’s feasible. But how many cancers can you apply this to? That we don’t know,” says ­Sadelain. “What’s changed is that everyone now knows what to do. I think that partly explains the frenzy around T cells.”The goal is to find the next CD19. But that’s not easily done. Since few antigens appear only on tumor cells, any targeted T cell runs the risk of wiping out vital organs, as happened to the colon cancer patient in 2009. The Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, a federal body that oversees gene therapy, called a meeting this June to debate how scientists planned to avoid these and other side effects. One way to lessen the risk is already being tested in patients: “suicide switches,” which let doctors rapidly kill off all the engineered T cells should any serious problems arise. This spring, Michael Jensen, a pediatric cancer doctor at Seattle Children’s whose cell-therapy center treated Wright, opened a study to treat neuroblastoma, the most common cancer affecting infants. He says T cells will target an antigen found on nerve cells. If the T cells do unexpected damage, they can be inactivated with a dose of the drug Erbitux.Safety isn’t the only obstacle. How can engineered T cells be made to persist in a person’s body to provide permanent protection? So far they don’t seem to linger in many patients, something Frohlich terms a “big problem.” And dense organ tumors can saturate their surroundings with signals, like a molecule called PD-L1, that turn T cells off. This defense is the process that checkpoint inhibitors, the new immunotherapy drugs sold by Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb, interfere with. But DNA engineering may offer clever solutions as well. Jensen says he rewired the DNA of T cells so this “off” signal instead provokes them to kill even more.Jensen is optimistic that rapidly improving techniques for modifying genes, and for handling and growing cells, will let researchers conquer solid tumors. “What is in the clinic now with leukemia is version 1.1 of this operating system,” he says. “But back in the labs, that is already antiquated technology.”One study I heard about is led by Marcela Maus, an oncologist at Penn, who this year tested engineered T cells in five patients with glioblastoma, an incurable brain cancer. When one of these patients underwent brain surgery, Maus discovered that the tumor had been mostly killed. No cancer cells with the marker she’d aimed at remained at all. So was this proof that T cells can treat brain cancer, too? Maus is reluctant to answer that question. “Potentially,” she says. It’s just too soon to know if these patients will live any longer than they would have otherwise. “It’s hard to exercise patience, but that is what is needed,” she says.When Wright’s white blood cells were collected in late 2013, they headed to a processing facility at Seattle Children’s. Workers laboring in masks and safety suits placed them into bioreactors and used a virus to insert the new DNA. Then the cells were grown for 10 days inside plastic sacks fed with human blood serum. If a half-dozen academic centers hadn’t built specialized clean rooms like this one, there wouldn’t be any clinical trials, or any IPOs. But Jensen’s center is no commercial operation: it can prepare cells for only 10 patients a month. It costs $75,000 to manufacture cells for each one.Jensen says about a quarter of the children whose parents want to enter them in the Seattle study aren’t accepted. Sometimes the reasons are medical, but not always: capacity is simply limited. “I wish every kid could get it,” Jensen says of the cell treatment. “The major barrier is the commercial end of it—having their factories built, having their trials done, and it being something that a doctor would be able to write a prescription for in any part of country.”In fact, no one is quite sure how a personalized cell therapy will be commercialized at a large scale. Schematics outlining how it would work typically show not just a dozen complex laboratory steps but two airplanes, to get cells to and from patients. That explains why the largest number of Juno’s employees are involved in process engineering. One of them, Chris Ramsborg, gave me a tour around what he called the “sandbox” where new ideas for growing and packaging cells are being worked out. But most of the equipment was hidden from sight. “The manufacturing technology and how we are deploying it is the secret of Juno,” he said. “The techniques to make these products don’t really exist yet.”Several members of Juno’s staff, including Ramsborg, Frohlich, and Hans Bishop, worked at another Seattle biotech named Dendreon, which developed a T-cell treatment for prostate cancer. (The cells, instead of being engineered, were exposed to cancer antigens and then multiplied. The treatment was only modestly effective.) Even though Dendreon charged $93,000 for its treatment, it cost half that much to manufacture. The company filed for bankruptcy last year.Dendreon’s manufacturing plant in New Jersey was scooped up by Novartis, which has started using it to process cells for patients involved in its leukemia study. Azam says Novartis, which has 400 people working in gene and cell therapy, is already studying the logistics of how a personalized cell therapy could be offered globally. “We have been mapping out how we would do the patient journey, the individual cell journey,” he says. “It’s a new way to treat patients, but also a new way of practicing business.”It may one day be possible to mass-produce off-the-shelf T cells or even do genetic engineering at a patient’s bedside. Some labs are working with instruments to pump genetic material into cells using electricity or pressure. Others have shown they can generate T cells in a lab dish and use them to cure mice, raising the possibility of T-cell factories. For now, though, all the engineered T-cell treatments in clinical testing use a patient’s own cells.So how much will a dose of genetically engineered immune cells cost? One Citigroup analyst estimated that the price could exceed $500,000. That would be more expensive than nearly any existing cancer drug. Yet it might be considered cheap if a 10-minute drip could effectively treat leukemia without causing permanent damage to the patient. Current chemotherapy treatments last for a year or more and can weaken a person’s heart and body for a lifetime. The hospital bills for leukemia patients can top $2 million.Harr, Juno’s CFO, was well known on Wall Street for criticizing the high cost of cancer drugs; he warned that the government might step in and set prices if they weren’t reined in. When I asked him about the T-cell treatments, he said it was too soon to guess at a price. It depends how well they work and how hard they are to make. “There’s no model for how much it costs,” he said. “But remember, we get to utter words like ‘cure.’ And at this point, it’s a single dose.”","Half a century ago, the N.C.I. was a very different place. It was dingy and underfunded—a fraction of its current size—and home to a raw and unruly medical staff. The orthodoxy of the time was that cancer was a death sentence: the tumor could be treated with surgery or radiation, in order to buy some time, and the patient’s inevitable decline could be eased through medicine, and that was it. At the N.C.I., however, an insurgent group led by Frei and Freireich believed that if cancer drugs were used in extremely large doses, and in multiple combinations and repeated cycles, the cancer could be beaten. “I wasn’t sure if these scientists were maniacs or geniuses,” DeVita writes. But, as he worked with Freireich on the N.C.I.’s childhood-leukemia ward—and saw the fruits of the first experiments using combination chemotherapy—he became a convert.The sound of vomiting could be heard along the hallway. Night after night, Moxley and I paced outside the rooms of our patients, fearful of what might happen. Over the weeks that followed, they lost weight and grew listless, and their platelet counts sank lower and lower to dangerous levels.Then came the surprise. Twelve of the fourteen patients in the initial trial went into remission—and nine stayed there as the months passed. In most cases, the tumors disappeared entirely, something that had never before been seen in the treatment of solid tumors. In the spring of 1965, DeVita went to Philadelphia to present the results to the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research. He stood up before the crowd and ran triumphantly through the data: “ ‘Our patients were, therefore,’ I said, savoring the dramatic conclusion, ‘in complete remission.’ ”What happened? An illustrious cancer expert named David Karnofsky made a narrow point about the appropriateness of the term “complete remission.” After that, nothing: “There were a few perfunctory questions about the severity of the side effects. But that was it.” History had been made in the world of cancer treatment, and no one seemed to care.Later, when DeVita and his fellow N.C.I. researcher George Canellos wanted to test a promising combination-chemotherapy treatment for advanced breast cancer, they had to do their trial overseas, because they couldn’t win the coöperation of surgeons at either of the major American cancer centers, Memorial Sloan Kettering or M. D. Anderson. When the cancer researcher Bernard Fisher did a study showing that there was no difference in outcome between radical mastectomies and the far less invasive lumpectomies, he called DeVita in distress. He couldn’t get the study published. “Breast surgeons made their living doing radical or total mastectomies, and they did not want to hear that that was no longer necessary,” DeVita writes. “Fisher had found it difficult to get patients referred to his study, in fact, because of this resistance.” The surgeons at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center were so stubborn that they went on disfiguring their patients with radical mastectomies for years after Fisher’s data had shown the procedure to be unnecessary. “The Death of Cancer” is an angry book, in which one of the critical figures in twentieth-century oncology unloads a lifetime of frustration with the obduracy and closed-mindedness of his profession. DeVita concludes, “There are incredibly promising therapies out there. If used to their fullest potential for all patients, I believe we could cure an additional 100,000 patients a year.” He is not the first to point out the shortcomings of clinical practice, of course. What sets “The Death of Cancer” apart is what he proposes to do about it.Their first step was to alter the combination of drugs in their protocol, replacing methotrexate with a newer compound called procarbazine. Next, they reëxamined the schedule of treatment. Combination chemotherapy is a delicate balancing act. Cancer drugs are typically so toxic that they can be given only in short bursts, so that patients can regain their strength. If the breaks are too long, though, the cancer comes roaring back. In the first trial, they had simply followed the schedule that Freireich used in treating leukemia. Hodgkin’s cells, however, were different. They divided more slowly—and, since cancer cells are most vulnerable when they are dividing, that suggested that the Hodgkin’s schedule needed to be a lot longer.They’d also cut the dose of procarbazine in half, because it made patients nauseous. And they’d reduced the dose of vincristine drastically because of the risk of nerve damage. They’d also added, at a minimum, an extra two weeks between cycles so that patients would have fully recovered from the toxic effects of the prior dose before they got the next. They gave no thought to the fact that the tumor would have been back on its feet by then, too, apparently.But here “The Death of Cancer” takes an unexpected turn. DeVita doesn’t think his experience with the stubborn physicians at Memorial Sloan Kettering or at Yale justifies greater standardization. He is wary of too many scripts and guidelines. What made the extraordinary progress against cancer at the N.C.I. during the nineteen-sixties and seventies possible, in his view, was the absence of rules. A good illustration was Freireich’s decision to treat Pseudomonas meningitis by injecting an antibiotic directly into the spinal fluid. DeVita writes:The first time Freireich told me to do it, I held up the vial and showed him the label, thinking that he’d possibly missed something. “It says right on there, ‘Do not use intrathecally,’ ” I said. Freireich glowered at me and pointed a long bony finger in my face. “Do it!” he barked. I did it, though I was terrified. But it worked every time.Clinical progress against a disease as wily and dimly understood as cancer, DeVita argues, happens when doctors have the freedom to try unorthodox things—and he worries that we have lost sight of that fact. By way of example, he tells the story of a friend of his, Lee, who was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer at the age of sixty. According to the practice guidelines, the best option for Lee was androgen-deprivation therapy, or A.D.T., which slows down the cancer cells by denying them testosterone. That’s what Lee’s doctor recommended. DeVita understood why: there are strong incentives—like the threat of malpractice suits—for doctors to adhere to treatment protocols. But DeVita judged that Lee’s cancer was so aggressive that A.D.T. would buy him only a short reprieve. The guidelines limited Lee’s treatment options at a moment when he needed maximum flexibility.Guidelines are backwards looking. With cancer, things change too rapidly for doctors to be able to rely on yesterday’s guidelines for long. These guidelines need to be updated frequently, and they rarely are, because this takes time and money. . . . Reliance on such standards inhibits doctors from trying something new.DeVita’s first thought was to get Lee enrolled in a pioneering trial at the Mayo Clinic, where surgeons were removing the prostate along with all surrounding lymph nodes. Fifteen per cent of patients who underwent the procedure survived free of disease. The Mayo doctors wouldn’t operate on Lee, however. His cancer was too advanced. So DeVita found someone who would. “I can be very persuasive,” he writes. Then he managed to get Lee enrolled in an experimental-drug trial for relapsed prostate-cancer patients—only to discover that the study’s protocol called for treatment to end after a fixed number of doses. DeVita felt that Lee needed a much longer course. Lee sought an exemption from the rules of the study, which required a judgment from the hospital’s institutional review board. The lead investigator declined to take it up. DeVita was devastated, though hardly surprised. The system was built to be inflexible.DeVita’s struggle to keep his friend alive goes on for years. He finagles his way into one experimental trial after another. He improvises. He works his contacts. Finally, with Lee at the end of the line, DeVita hears of an experimental drug called abiraterone. But he can’t get Lee into the trial: the study’s protocol forbids it. DeVita tries to find his way around the rules and fails—and he’s heartbroken when he learns, after Lee finally succumbs to the disease, that abiraterone is so effective against advanced prostate cancer that the trial is stopped in mid-course and the patients in the control group are switched over to the new drug. “I could have told you a story with a happy ending,” DeVita writes, speaking of what he is sure was his friend’s premature death. “I instead chose to tell you one that could have had a happy ending because it illustrates what has been, for me, a source of perennial frustration: at this date, we are not limited by the science; we are limited by our ability to make good use of the information and treatments we already have.”Practice guidelines would have made the task of curing Hodgkin’s patients with DeVita’s regimen a lot easier. But had those guidelines been in place in the mid-sixties, when DeVita was making the rounds on behalf of his new treatment, they would have imposed a tax on other innovators. The obstacles he encountered in trying to save his friend Lee, similarly, were not capricious or arbitrary. They were there to insure that the results of clinical trials were as clear and persuasive as possible. It’s just that they had a cost—Lee’s death—and in DeVita’s mind that cost was too high.The angriest chapter of “The Death of Cancer” is devoted to the Food and Drug Administration, because DeVita believes that it has fundamentally misunderstood the trade-off between diffusion and innovation. The agency wants all new drugs to be shown to be safe and efficacious, to be as good as or better than existing therapies (or a placebo) in a randomized experiment involving the largest possible number of patients. For example, the F.D.A. might ask that patients getting an experimental treatment have better long-term survival rates than those receiving drug treatments already in use. The F.D.A. is the country’s diffusion gatekeeper: its primary goal is to make sure that good drugs get a gold star and bad drugs never make it to market.DeVita reminds us, though, that this gatekeeping can hinder progress. A given tumor, for instance, can rarely be stopped with a single drug. Cancer is like a door with three locks, each of which requires a different key. Suppose you came up with a drug that painlessly opened the first of those three locks. That drug would be a breakthrough. But it can’t cure anything on its own. So how do you get it through a trial that requires proof of efficacy—especially if you don’t yet know what the right keys for the two remaining locks are? Since cancer comes in a dizzying variety of types and subtypes, each with its own molecular profile, we want researchers to be free to experiment with different combinations of keys. Instead, DeVita argues, the F.D.A. has spent the past two decades pushing cancer medicine in the opposite direction. He continues:There’s a second problem with the “efficacy” requirement. Suppose Drug A, the existing treatment for a certain type of cancer, wipes out all but a billion cells in the typical patient’s tumor. Drug B, your alternative, wipes out all but a handful. DeVita points out two curious facts. First, a typical tumor has so many billions of cells that even a drug that leaves a billion cells untouched will look good after an initial treatment cycle. More important, after five years the patients on both Drugs A and B may have identical survival rates. That’s because of something called the Norton-Simon effect: smaller populations of cancer cells grow back faster than larger populations. But, in reality, Drugs A and B aren’t identical. If you are designing a combination of drugs to cure a cancer, DeVita writes, “the treatment that reduced the population to a few cells is the one you want to go forward with.” How many researchers and companies sit on promising therapies because they don’t want to spend several hundred million dollars on a clinical trial, only to fall short of the F.D.A.’s high bar?DeVita would have the F.D.A. take a step sideways—away from worrying exclusively about standards and safety, and closer to the innovation end of the continuum. In this respect, his position echoes that of Peter Huber, who in his 2013 book, “The Cure in the Code,” called on the F.D.A. to stop evaluating drugs as cures and start evaluating them as tools—“molecular scalpels, clamps, sutures, or dressings, to be picked off the shelf and used carefully but flexibly down at the molecular level.”"]
