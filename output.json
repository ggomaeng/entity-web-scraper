["","Welcome to Machine Learning! In this module, we introduce the core idea of teaching a computer to learn concepts using data—without being explicitly programmed. The Course Wiki is under construction. Please visit the resources tab for the most complete and up-to-date information.Linear regression predicts a real-valued output based on an input value. We discuss the application of linear regression to housing price prediction, present the notion of a cost function, and introduce the gradient descent method for learning.This course includes programming assignments designed to help you understand how to implement the learning algorithms in practice. To complete the programming assignments, you will need to use Octave or MATLAB. This module introduces Octave/Matlab and shows you how to submit an assignment.Logistic regression is a method for classifying data into discrete outcomes. For example, we might use logistic regression to classify an email  as spam or not spam. In this module, we introduce the notion of classification, the cost function for logistic regression, and the application of logistic regression to multi-class classification.\nNeural networks is a model inspired by how the brain works. It is widely used today in many applications: when your phone interprets and understand your voice commands, it is likely that a neural network is helping to understand your speech; when you cash a check, the machines that automatically read the digits also use neural networks. To optimize a machine learning algorithm, you’ll need to first understand where the biggest improvements can be made. In this module, we discuss how to understand the performance of a machine learning system with multiple parts, and also how to deal with skewed data.\nGiven a large number of data points, we may sometimes want to figure out which ones vary significantly from the average. For example, in manufacturing, we may want to detect defects or anomalies. We show how a dataset can be modeled using a Gaussian distribution, and how the model can be used for anomaly detection.\nWhen you buy a product online, most websites automatically recommend other products that you may like. Recommender systems look at patterns of activities between different users and different products to produce these recommendations. In this module, we introduce recommender algorithms such as the collaborative filtering algorithm and low-rank matrix factorization.The Leland Stanford Junior University, commonly referred to as Stanford University or Stanford, is an American private research university located in Stanford, California on an 8,180-acre (3,310 ha) campus near Palo Alto, California, United States.","While many machine learning algorithms have been around for a long time, the ability to automatically apply complex mathematical calculations to big data – over and over, faster and faster – is a recent development. Here are a few widely publicized examples of machine learning applications you may be familiar with:Most industries working with large amounts of data have recognized the value of machine learning technology. By gleaning insights from this data – often in real time – organizations are able to work more efficiently or gain an advantage over competitors.Data mining can be considered a superset of many different methods to extract insights from data. It might involve traditional statistical methods and machine learning. Data mining applies methods from many different areas to identify previously unknown patterns from data. This can include statistical algorithms, machine learning, text analytics, time series analysis and other areas of analytics. Data mining also includes the study and practice of data storage and data manipulation.The main difference with machine learning is that just like statistical models, the goal is to understand the structure of the data – fit theoretical distributions to the data that are well understood. So, with statistical models there is a theory behind the model that is mathematically proven, but this requires that data meets certain strong assumptions too. Machine learning has developed based on the ability to use computers to probe the data for structure, even if we do not have a theory of what that structure looks like. The test for a machine learning model is a validation error on new data, not a theoretical test that proves a null hypothesis. Because machine learning often uses an iterative approach to learn from data, the learning can be easily automated. Passes are run through the data until a robust pattern is found.To get the most value from machine learning, you have to know how to pair the best algorithms with the right tools and processes. SAS combines rich, sophisticated heritage in statistics and data mining with new architectural advances to ensure your models run as fast as possible – even in huge enterprise environments.Those driverless cars we keep hearing about from Google? They’re just one example of machine learning – and we’re about to hear of many more. Even though the concept of machine learning has been around for decades, it’s now becoming more pertinent to our daily lives because of increased amounts of data, cheaper storage and greater processing power.It discusses challenges and how to overcome them, presents a guide to machine-learning best practices and popular machine-learning algorithms,  and looks at how two organizations are exploiting machine learning for their analytic evolution.What happens when two increasingly popular technology concepts – machine learning and the Internet of Things – join forces? Mika Tanskanen, a manufacturing industry consultant in Finland, says the IoT can help machine learning reach even higher levels of efficiency.","This guide is intended to be accessible to anyone. Basic concepts in probability, statistics, programming, linear algebra, and calculus will be discussed, but it isn’t necessary to have prior knowledge of them to gain value from this series.Artificial intelligence will shape our future more powerfully than any other innovation this century. Anyone who does not understand it will soon find themselves feeling left behind, waking up in a world full of technology that feels more and more like magic.In everyday life, it’s increasingly commonplace to discover machines in roles traditionally occupied by humans. Really, don’t be surprised if a little housekeeping delivery bot shows up instead of a human next time you call the hotel desk to send up some toothpaste.In this series, we’ll explore the core machine learning concepts behind these technologies. By the end, you should be able to describe how they work at a conceptual level and be equipped with the tools to start building similar applications yourself.“It’s part of the history of the field of artificial intelligence that every time somebody figured out how to make a computer do something — play good checkers, solve simple but relatively informal problems — there was chorus of critics to say, ‘that’s not thinking’”Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an ‘intelligence explosion,’ and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control. — I.J. Good, 1965Machine learning is at the core of our journey towards artificial general intelligence, and in the meantime, it will change every industry and have a massive impact on our day-to-day lives. That’s why we believe it’s worth understanding machine learning, at least at a conceptual level — and we designed this series to be the best place to start.Most of this series was written during a 10-day trip to the United Kingdom in a frantic blur of trains, planes, cafes, pubs and wherever else we could find a dry place to sit. Our aim was to solidify our own understanding of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and how the methods therein fit together — and hopefully create something worth sharing in the process.","","As technology, and, importantly, our understanding of how our minds work, has progressed, our concept of what constitutes AI has changed. Rather than increasingly complex calculations, work in the field of AI concentrated on mimicking human decision making processes and carrying out tasks in ever more human ways.Artificial Intelligences – devices designed to act intelligently – are often classified into one of two fundamental groups – applied or general. Applied AI is far more common – systems designed to intelligently trade stocks and shares, or manoeuvre an autonomous vehicle would fall into this category.Generalized AIs – systems or devices which can in theory handle any task – are less common, but this is where some of the most exciting advancements are happening today. It is also the area that has led to the development of Machine Learning. Often referred to as a subset of AI, it’s really more accurate to think of it as the current state-of-the-art.","A recent news item went as follows: “Apple buys machine learning firm Perceptio Inc., a startup, in an attempt to bring advanced image-classifying artificial intelligence to smartphones by reducing data overhead which is typically required of conventional methods.” Another recent development was that MIT researchers were working on object recognition through flexible machine learning.Machine learning is a core sub-area of artificial intelligence; it enables computers to get into a mode of self-learning without being explicitly programmed. When exposed to new data, these computer programs are enabled to learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves.SAS, a North Carolina-based analytics software developer, uses this definition: “Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.” In other words, it allows computers to find insightful information without being programmed where to look for a particular piece of information; instead, it does this by using algorithms that iteratively learn from data.All these examples echo the vital role machine learning has begun to take in today’s data-rich world. Machines can aid in filtering useful pieces of information that help in major advancements, and we are already seeing how this technology is being implemented in a wide variety of industries.With the constant evolution of the field, there has been a subsequent rise in the uses, demands, and importance of machine learning. Big data has become quite a buzzword in the last few years; that’s in part due to increased sophistication of machine learning, which helps analyze those big chunks of big data. Machine learning has also changed the way data extraction, and interpretation is done by involving automatic sets of generic methods that have replaced traditional statistical techniques.Earlier in this article, we mentioned some applications of machine learning. To understand the concept of machine learning better, let’s consider some more examples: web search results, real-time ads on web pages and mobile devices, email spam filtering, network intrusion detection, and pattern and image recognition. All these are by-products of applying machine learning to analyze huge volumes of data.Traditionally, data analysis was always being characterized by trial and error, an approach that becomes impossible when data sets are large and heterogeneous. Machine learning comes as the solution to all this chaos by proposing clever alternatives to analyzing huge volumes of data. By developing fast and efficient algorithms and data-driven models for real-time processing of data, machine learning is able to produce accurate results and analysis.Whether you realize it or not, machine learning is one of the most important technology trends—it underlies so many things we use today without even thinking about them. Speech recognition, Amazon and Netflix recommendations, fraud detection, and financial trading are just a few examples of machine learning commonly in use in today’s data-driven world.Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge—and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.How exactly do machines learn? Two popular methods of machine learning are supervised learning and unsupervised learning. It is estimated that about 70 percent of machine learning is supervised learning, while unsupervised learning ranges from 10 – 20 percent. Other methods that are less-often used are semi-supervised and reinforcement learning. This kind of learning is possible when inputs and the outputs are clearly identified, and algorithms are trained using labeled examples. To understand this better, let’s consider the following example: an equipment could have data points labeled F (failed) or R (runs).The learning algorithm using supervised learning would receive a set of inputs along with the corresponding correct output to find errors. Based on these inputs, it would further modify the model accordingly. This is a form of pattern recognition, as supervised learning happens through methods like classification, regression, prediction, and gradient boosting. Supervised learning uses patterns to predict the values of the label on additional unlabeled data.Popular techniques where unsupervised learning is used also include self-organizing maps, nearest neighbor mappig, singular value decomposition, and k-means clustering. Basically, online recommendations, identification of data outliers, and segment text topics are all examples of unsupervised learning.As the name suggests, semi-supervised learning is a bit of both supervised and unsupervised learning and uses both labeled and unlabeled data for training. In a typical scenario, the algorithm would use a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data.This is a bit similar to the traditional type of data analysis; the algorithm discovers through trial and error and decides which action results in greater rewards. Three major components can be identified in reinforcement learning functionality: the agent, the environment, and the actions. The agent is the learner or decision-maker, the environment includes everything that the agent interacts with, and the actions are what the agent can do.If you’re studying machine learning, you should familiarize yourself with these common machine learning algorithms and processes: neural networks, decision trees, random forests, associations and sequence discovery, gradient boosting and bagging, support vector machines, self-organizing maps, k-means clustering, Bayesian networks, Gaussian mixture models, and more.\n                        Priyadharshini is a knowledge analyst at Simplilearn, specializing in Project Management, IT, Six Sigma, and e-Learning.

She was previously associated with Oxford University Press and Pearson Education, India.                    A feature vector is an n-dimensional vector of numerical features that represent some object. In machine learning, feature vectors are used to represent numeric or symbolic characteristics, called features, of an object in a mathematical, easily analyzable way.Root cause analysis was initially developed to analyze industrial accidents, but is now widely used in other areas. It is a problem solving technique used for isolating the root causes of faults or problems. A factor is called a root cause if its deduction from the problem-fault-sequence averts the final undesirable event from reoccurring.It is a model validation technique for evaluating how the outcomes of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent data set. It is mainly used in backgrounds where the objective is forecast and one wants to estimate how accurately a model will accomplish in practice. The goal of cross-validation is to term a data set to test the model in the training phase (i.e. validation data set) in order to limit problems like overfitting, and gain insight on how the model will generalize to an independent data set.It is a theorem that describes the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times. This theorem forms the basis of frequency-style thinking. It says that the sample mean, the sample variance and the sample standard deviation converge to what they are trying to estimate.It is a traditional database schema with a central table. Satellite tables map IDs to physical names or descriptions and can be connected to the central fact table using the ID fields; these tables are known as lookup tables and are principally useful in real-time applications, as they save a lot of memory. Sometimes star schemas involve several layers of summarization to recover information faster.Eigenvectors are for understanding linear transformations. In data analysis, we usually calculate the eigenvectors for a correlation or covariance matrix. Eigenvalues are the directions along which a particular linear transformation acts by flipping, compressing or stretching.An experienced process analyst at Simplilearn, the author specializes in adapting current quality management best practices to the needs of fast-paced digital businesses.

For example, let's say that you want to train an ML model to predict if an\n                        email is spam\n                        or not spam. You would provide Amazon ML with training data that contains emails for\n                        which you know\n                        the target (that is, a label that tells whether an email is spam or not spam). Amazon\n                        ML would train\n                        an ML model by using this data, resulting in a model that attempts to predict whether\n                        new email\n                        will be spam or not spam. \n                     ","The volume of data is too large for comprehensive analysis, and the range of potential correlations and relationships between disparate data sources — from back end customer databases to live web based clickstreams —are too great for any analyst to test all hypotheses and derive all the value buried in the data.Basic analytical methods used in business intelligence and enterprise reporting tools reduce to reporting sums, counts, simple averages and running SQL queries. Online analytical processing is merely a systematized extension of these basic analytics that still rely on a human to direct activities specify what should be calculated.It delivers on the promise of extracting value from big and disparate data sources with far less reliance on human direction. It is data driven and runs at machine scale. It is well suited to the complexity of dealing with disparate data sources and the huge variety of variables and amounts of data involved. And unlike traditional analysis, machine learning thrives on growing datasets. The more data fed into a machine learning system, the more it can learn and apply the results to higher quality insights.“Data analytics is about discovering knowledge from large volumes data and applying it to the business. In this process, the speed of the data scientist is actually a limiting factor. Skytree makes this much less of a limiting factor. It accelerates the work of the data scientist.","The most powerful form of machine learning being used today, called “deep learning”, builds a complex mathematical structure called a neural network based on vast quantities of data. Designed to be analogous to how a human brain works, neural networks themselves were first described in the 1930s. But it’s only in the last three or four years that computers have become powerful enough to use them effectively.Corrado says he thinks it is as big a change for tech as the internet was. “Before internet technologies, if you worked in computer science, networking was some weird thing that weirdos did. And now everyone, regardless of whether they’re an engineer or a software developer or a product designer or a CEO understands how internet connectivity shapes their product, shapes the market, what they could possibly build.”He says that same kind of transformation is going to happen with machine learning. “It ends up being something that everybody can do a little of. They don’t have to do the detailed things, but they need to understand ‘well, wait a minute, maybe we could do this if we had data to learn from.’”One of the nice things about the machine learning community right now is how open it is to sharing ideas and research. When Google made TensorFlow open to anyone to use, it wrote: “By sharing what we believe to be one of the best machine learning toolboxes in the world, we hope to create an open standard for exchanging research ideas and putting machine learning in products”. And it’s not alone in that: every major machine learning implementation is available for free to use and modify, meaning it’s possible to set up a simple machine intelligence with nothing more than a laptop and a web connection.I’m not the only one to play around with the technology. Quietly, starting a few years ago, Google itself has undergone a metamorphosis. The search giant has torn out the guts of some of its biggest services, from image search to voice recognition, and recreated them from the ground up. Now, it wants the rest of the world to follow suit.On 16 June, it announced that it was opening a dedicated Machine Learning group in its Zurich engineering office, the largest collection of Google developers outside of the US, to lead research into three areas: machine intelligence, natural language processing, and machine perception. That is, building systems that can think, listen, and see.Following Sloan’s example, I set my model up to run as an autocomplete engine. I could write the first half-sentance of a theoretical Guardian editorial, and the system gets fed it as an input and asked what it thinks will come next. Don’t like that? Ask it for another response.It’s terrible. Of course it’s terrible: if I could train a machine to write a convincing Guardian editorial, or even a convincing sentence extract from a Guardian editorial, in two days by copying a readme and fiddling around with complex software which I don’t really understand even after having successfully used it, then my job would be much less secure than it is. Hell, everyone’s jobs would be much less secure than they are. While the results are unimpressive on the face of it, at the same time, however, they’re … kind of amazing. The specific package I used, called Torch-rnn, is designed for training character-level neural networks. That is, before it’s trained, it doesn’t even know the concept of a word, let alone have a specific vocabulary or understanding of English grammar.It still can’t actually create meaning. That makes sense: a Guardian editorial has meaning in relation to the real world, not as a collection of words existing in its own right. And so to properly train a neural network to write one, you’d also have to feed in information about the world, and then you’ve got less of a weekend project and more of a startup pitch.So it’s not surprising to see the number of startup pitches that do involve “deep learning” skyrocket. My inbox has consistently seen one or two a day for the past year, from an “online personal styling service” which uses deep learning to match people to clothes, to a “knowledge discovery engine” which aims to beat Google at its own game.Where the archetypal startup of 2008 was “x but on a phone” and the startup of 2014 was “uber but for x”, this year is the year of “doing x with machine learning”. And Google seems happy to be leading the way, not only with its own products, but also by making the tools which the rest of the ecosystem is relying on.But that’s going to change. It will get quicker, easier and more effective, and slowly move from something the engineers know about, to something the whole development team know about, then the whole tech industry, and then, eventually, everyone. And when it does, it’s going to change a lot else with it.\n                    … we have a small favour to ask. More people are reading the Guardian than ever but advertising revenues across the media are falling fast. And unlike many news organisations, we haven’t put up a paywall – we want to keep our journalism as open as we can. So you can see why we need to ask for your help. The Guardian’s independent, investigative journalism takes a lot of time, money and hard work to produce. But we do it because we believe our perspective matters – because it might well be your perspective, too.\n                ","For Holgate, who came to Google almost four years ago with a degree in computer science and math, it’s a chance to master the hottest paradigm of the software world: using learning algorithms (“learners”) and tons of data to “teach” software to accomplish its tasks. For many years, machine learning was considered a specialty, limited to an elite few. That era is over, as recent results indicate that machine learning, powered by “neural nets” that emulate the way a biological brain operates, is the true path towards imbuing computers with the powers of humans, and in some cases, super humans. Google is committed to expanding that elite within its walls, with the hope of making it the norm. For engineers like Holgate, the ninja program is a chance to leap to the forefront of the effort, learning from the best of the best. “These people are building ridiculous models and have PhD’s,” she says, unable to mask the awe in her voice. She’s even gotten over the fact that she is actually in a program that calls its students “ninjas.” “At first, I cringed, but I learned to accept it,” she says.“The more people who think about solving problems in this way, the better we’ll be,” says a leader in the firm’s ML effort, Jeff Dean, who is to software at Google as Tom Brady is to quarterbacking in the NFL. Today, he estimates that of Google’s 25,000 engineers, only a “few thousand” are proficient in machine learning. Maybe ten percent. He’d like that to be closer to a hundred percent. “It would be great to have every engineer have at least some amount of knowledge of machine learning,” he says.These improved neural-net algorithms along with more powerful computation from the Moore’s Law effect and an exponential increase in data drawn from the behavior of huge numbers of users at companies like Google and Facebook, began a new era of ascendant machine learning. Giannandrea joined those who believed it should be central to the company. That cohort included Dean, co-founder of the Google Brain , a neural net project originating in the company’s long-range research division Google X. (Now known simply as X.)Google’s bear-hug-level embrace of machine learning does not simply represent a shift in programming technique. It’s a serious commitment to techniques that will bestow hitherto unattainable powers to computers. The leading edge of this are “deep learning” algorithms built around sophisticated neural nets inspired by brain architecture. Google Brain is a deep learning effort, and DeepMind, the AI company Google bought for a reported $500 million in January 2014, also concentrates on that end of the spectrum. It was DeepMind that created the AlphaGo system that beat a champion of Go, shattering expectations of intelligent machine performance and sending ripples of concern among those fearful of smart machines and killer robots.While Giannandrea dismisses the “AI-is-going-to-kill us” camp as ill-informed Cassandras, he does contend that machine learning systems are going to be transformative, in everything from medical diagnoses to driving our cars. While machine learning won’t replace humans, it will change humanity.That understanding hadn’t yet hit in 2012 when Giannandrea had the idea to “get a bunch of people who were doing this stuff” and put them in a single building. Google Brain, which had “graduated” from the X division, joined the party. “We uprooted a bunch of teams, put them in a building, got a nice new coffee machine,” he says. “People who previously had just been working on what we called perception — sound and speech understanding and so on — were now talking to the people who were trying to work on language.”Google boosted the odds by keeping Corrado and his team in close and constant contact with the Gmail group, an approach that is increasingly common as machine learning experts fan out among product groups. “Machine learning is as much art as it is science,” says Corrado. “It’s like cooking — yes, there’s chemistry involved but to do something really interesting, you have to learn how to combine the ingredients available to you.”When the team began testing Smart Reply, though, users noted a weird quirk: it would often suggest inappropriate romantic responses. “One of the failure modes was this really hysterical tendency for it to say, ‘I love you’ whenever it got confused,” says Corrado. “It wasn’t a software bug — it was an error in what we asked it to do.” The program had somehow learned a subtle aspect of human behavior: “If you’re cornered, saying, ‘I love you’ is a good defensive strategy.” Corrado was able to help the team tamp down the ardor.Smart Reply is only one data point in a dense graph of instances where ML has proved effective at Google. But perhaps the ultimate turning point came when machine learning became an integral part of search, Google’s flagship product and the font of virtually all its revenues. Search has always been based on artificial intelligence to some degree. But for many years, the company’s most sacred algorithms, those that delivered what were once known as the “ten blue links” in response to a search query, were deemed too important for ML’s learning algorithms. “Because search is such a large part of the company, ranking is very, very highly evolved, and there was a lot of skepticism you could move the needle very much,” says Giannandrea.In part this was a cultural resistance — a stubborn microcosm of the general challenge of getting control-freaky master hackers to adopt the Zen-ish machine learning approach. Amit Singhal, the long-time maester of search, was himself an acolyte of Gerald Salton, a legendary computer scientist whose pioneering work in document retrieval inspired Singhal to help revise the grad-student code of Brin and Page into something that could scale in the modern web era. (This put him in the school of “retrievers.”) He teased amazing results from those 20th century methods, and was suspicious of integrating learners into the complicated system that was Google’s lifeblood. “My first two years at Google I was in search quality, trying to use machine learning to improve ranking,” says David Pablo Cohn. “It turns out that Amit’s intuition was the best in the world, and we did better by trying to hard code whatever was in Amit’s brain. We couldn’t find anything as good as his approach.”By early 2014, Google’s machine learning masters believed that should change. “We had a series of discussions with the ranking team,” says Dean. “We said we should at least try this and see, is there any gain to be had.” The experiment his team had in mind turned out to be central to search: how well a document in the ranking matches a query (as measured by whether the user clicks on it). “We sort of just said, let’s try to compute this extra score from the neural net and see if that’s a useful score.”It turned out the answer was yes, and the system is now part of search, known as RankBrain. It went online in April 2015. Google is characteristically fuzzy on exactly how it improves search (something to do with the long tail? Better interpretation of ambiguous requests?) but Dean says that RankBrain is “involved in every query,” and affects the actual rankings “probably not in every query but in a lot of queries.” What’s more, it’s hugely effective. Of the hundreds of “signals” Google search uses when it calculates its rankings (a signal might be the user’s geographical location, or whether the headline on a page matches the text in the query), RankBrain is now rated as the third most useful.But since academic programs are not yet producing ML experts in huge numbers, retraining workers is a necessity. And that isn’t always easy, especially at a company like Google, with many world-class engineers who have spent a lifetime achieving wizardry through traditional coding.Machine learning requires a different mindset. People who are master coders often become that way because they thrive on the total control that one can have by programming a system. Machine learning also requires a grasp of certain kinds of math and statistics, which many coders, even gonzo hackers who can zip off tight programs of brobdingnagian length, never bothered to learn.It also requires a degree of patience. “The machine learning model is not a static piece of code — you're constantly feeding it data,” says Robson. “We are constantly updating the models and learning, adding more data and tweaking how we're going to make predictions. It feels like a living, breathing thing. It’s a different kind of engineering.”“It’s a discipline really of doing experimentation with the different algorithms, or about which sets of training data work really well for your use case,” says Giannandrea, who despite his new role as search czar still considers evangelizing machine learning internally as part of his job. “The computer science part doesn’t go away. But there is more of a focus on mathematics and statistics and less of a focus on writing half a million lines of code.”While Google takes pains to couch the move as an altruistic boon to the community, it also acknowledges that a new generation of programmers familiar with its in-house machine learning tools is a pretty good thing for Google recruiting. (Skeptics have noted that Google’s open-sourcing TensorFlow is a catch-up move with Facebook, which publicly released deep-learning modules for an earlier ML system, Torch, in January 2015.) Still, TensorFlow’s features, along with the Google imprimatur, have rapidly made it a favorite in ML programming circles. According to Giannandrea, when Google offered its first online TensorFlow course, 75,000 people signed up.But since Google’s biggest need is people to design and refine these systems, just as the company is working feverishly to refine its software-training tools, it’s madly honing its experiments in training machine-learning engineers. They range from small to large. The latter category includes quick-and-dirty two-day “Machine Learning Crash Course with TensorFlow,” with slides and exercises. Google hopes this is a first taste, and the engineers will subsequently seek out resources to learn more. “We have thousands of people signed up for the next offering of this one course,” says Dean.Other, smaller efforts draw outsiders into Google’s machine learning maw. Earlier this spring, Google began the Brain Residency program, a program to bring in promising outsiders for a year of intense training from within the Google Brain group. “We’re calling it a jump start in your Deep Learning career,” says Robson, who helps administer the program. Though it’s possible that some of the 27 machine-learning-nauts from different disciplines in the initial program might wind up sticking around Google, the stated purpose of the class is to dispatch them back in the wild, using their superpowers to spread Google’s version of machine learning throughout the data-sphere.Her program began with a four-week boot camp where the product leads of Google’s most advanced AI projects drilled them on the fine points of baking machine learning into projects. “We throw the ninjas into a conference room and Greg Corrado is there at the white board, explaining LSTM [“Long Short Term Memory,” a technique that makes powerful neural nets], gesturing wildly, showing how this really works, what the math is, how to use it in production,” says Robson. “We basically just do this with every technique we have and every tool in our toolbox for the first four weeks to give them a really immersive dive.”Holgate has survived boot camp and now is using machine learning tools to build a communications feature in Android that will help Googlers communicate with each other. She’s tuning hyperparameters. She’s cleansing her input data. She’s stripping out the stop words. But there’s no way she’s turning back, because she knows that these artificial intelligence techniques are the present and the future of Google, maybe of all technology. Maybe of everything.","It's very difficult, if not impossible, for us humans to understand how robots see the world. Their cameras work like our eyes do, but the space between the image that a camera captures and actionable information about that image is filled with a black box of machine learning algorithms that are trying to translate patterns of features into something that they're familiar with. Training these algorithms usually involves showing them a set of different pictures of something (like a stop sign), and then seeing if they can extract enough common features from those pictures to reliably identify stop signs that aren’t in their training set.This works pretty well, but the common features that machine learning algorithms come up with generally are not “red octagons with the letters S-T-O-P on them.” Rather, they're looking features that all stop signs share, but would not be in the least bit comprehensible to a human looking at them. If this seems hard to visualize, that's because it reflects a fundamental disconnect between the way our brains and artificial neural networks interpret the world.Obviously, it's totally, uh, obvious to us that both images feature a panda. The differences between the first and third images are invisible to us, and even when the alterations are shown explicitly, there's nothing in there that looks all that much like a gibbon. But to a neural network-based classifier, the first image is probably a panda while the third image is almost definitely a gibbon. This kind of thing also works with street signs, causing signs that look like one thing to us to look like something completely different to the vision system of an autonomous car, which could be very dangerous for obvious reasons.Adversarial attacks like these, while effective, are much harder to do in practice, because you usually don't have direct digital access to the inputs of the neural network you're trying to mess with. Also, in the context of something like an autonomous car, the neural network has the opportunity to analyze a whole bunch of images of a sign at different distances and angles as it approaches. And lastly, adversarial images tend to include introduced features over the entire image (both the sign and the background), which doesn't work in real life.Because the stickers have a much smaller area to work with than the posters, the perturbations they create have to be more significant, but it's certainly not obvious that they're not just some random graffiti. And they work almost as well. According to the researchers:The Stop sign is misclassified into our target class of Speed Limit 45 in 100% of the images taken according to our evaluation methodology. For the Right Turn sign… Our attack reports a 100% success rate for misclassification with 66.67% of the images classified as a Stop sign and 33.7% of the images classified as an Added Lane sign. [The camouflage graffiti] attack succeeds in causing 73.33% of the images to be misclassified. In [the camouflage abstract art attack], we achieve a 100% misclassification rate into our target class. In order to develop these attacks, the researchers trained their own road sign classifier in TensorFlow using a publicly available, labeled dataset of road signs. They assumed that an attacker would have “white box” access to the classifier, meaning that they can't mess with its training or its guts, but that they can feed things in and see what comes out— like if you owned an autonomous car, and could show it whatever signs you wanted and see if it recognized them or not, a reasonable assumption to make. Even if you can't hack directly into the classifier itself, you could still use this feedback to create a reasonably accurate model of how it classifies things. Finally, the researchers take the image of the sign you want to attack and feed it plus their classifier into an attack algorithm that outputs the adversarial image for you. Mischief managed.","Machine learning enables analysis of massive quantities of data. While it generally delivers faster, more accurate results in order to identify profitable opportunities or dangerous risks, it may also require additional time and resources to train it properly.

The journal publishes articles reporting substantive results on a wide range of learning methods applied to a variety of learning problems. The journal features papers that describe research on problems and methods, applications research, and issues of research methodology. Papers making claims about learning problems or methods provide solid support via empirical studies, theoretical analysis, or comparison to psychological phenomena. Applications papers show how to apply learning methods to solve important applications problems. Research methodology papers improve how machine learning research is conducted. All papers describe the supporting evidence in ways that can be verified or replicated by other researchers. The papers also detail the learning component clearly and discuss assumptions regarding knowledge representation and the performance task.Science Citation Index, Science Citation Index Expanded (SciSearch), Journal Citation Reports/Science Edition, SCOPUS, PsycINFO, INSPEC, Zentralblatt Math, Google Scholar, Academic OneFile, ACM Digital Library, Computer Abstracts International Database, Current Abstracts, Current Contents/Engineering, Computing  and Technology, DBLP, Earthquake Engineering Abstracts, EBSCO Applied Science & Technology Source, EBSCO Associates Programs Source, EBSCO Book Review Digest Plus (H.W.
